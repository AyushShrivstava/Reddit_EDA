The writer's intention is not to write anything about the ""Rajapakse"" siblings !! It is about their uncle ""Col.Gotabhaya Rajapaskse"" whose name will be remembered by all Sinhalese in SL for perpetuity !! 

A few will have bad things to say about the Col !! I for one do not care !! I would opine that there are two Colonels in the world !! One is Col.Gaddafi who is no more !! The other is our own Col.Gotabhaya Rajapakse !! Both have certain similarities!! 

They never went over their rank !! Col.Gaddafi had he wanted could have made himself the ""Emperor"" of Libya or at least a ""General Field Marshal""in the Libyan Army !! He did neither !! Col.Gotabhaya could have himself appointed at least a ""General"" !! 

After all President MR was his brother as well as the Commander-in-Chief and would have been very happy to comply if requested by the Col !! Neither did so !! As far as I know the Colonel commanded the 1st Battalion of the ""Gajaba"" Regiment !! The foremost ""fighting"" regiment of the SL Army !! 

They remained Colonels throughout, Gaddafi to the ""bitter end"". Col.Gottabhaya took certain key decisions when fighting the LTTE and faced imminent dangers which would finished off a lesser person !! 

Had the Colonel not done so or failed in his decisions, we Sri Lankans would have had to pay dearly with our lives !! Now of course, we can talk high and mighty about Human Rights and various assorted subjects !! At that point of time we were very near extinction !! After all every community has its own heroes !! In India ""King Sivaji"" is a hero !!

Try and see what happens, if someone talks bad about ""King Sivaji"" in India !! I suppose he will not come out alive !! So why cant we have our own heroes !! Is it a crime if we do so !! Now, Muslim people will always remember Colonels Fasly Lafir and Muthalif !! 

Even in the Tamil community there were and still are highly respected officers who made the ultimate sacrifice !! We must salute them all !! Their heroism and gallantry is unquestioned !! 

Likewise, whatever happens at the elections, I as at least as a Sinhalalese will get a lump in my throat whenever I remember our own Col. Gotabhaya Rajapaskse !! May the Colonel have the courage to overcome all the tribulations at this point of his life !!L",neutral,neutral,positive,neutral

With the cost of living sky rocketing, you can't blame people for not wanting to pay taxes. I am sure that people won't mind paying if it meant things will get better in the future. But we all know that is not going to happen.

Politicians can't steal from the government coffers so they are taking from people. How can people live? Let alone do other things such as buy a car or even get married? We can't keep our lives on hold waiting for a resolution that will never come.

j5szofv,t3_10kns91,12,0,1674642011.0,Relation_Senior,"So my parents are doctors and we pay income taxes. Wouldn’t say how much but it’s a lot. Even though we have declared all our assets and payed our due without any delay at all, they STILL try to find SOMETHING they could use to get more money. And basically, going to answer their questions is about the same as an interrogation.

Additionally, the tax process of our country is very complicated and hard for a laymen to understand, which isn’t the case with other so-called “developed” countries.

Plus, my parents also get taxes cut off their salaries in ADDITION to the income tax. The amount cut isn’t small.

This is why many government professionals are against increasing taxes.

Not to mention the fact that the government has implemented a lot of circular taxes, which is why many of the things in your neighborhood supermarket have become eye-wateringly expensive.

But yeah, the truth is most of the people in this country didn’t and don’t pay taxes. The government always took taxes from their employees, but not from rest of the general population. Whenever they needed some more cash, they always took from the people working for them. Many private businessmen would earn much, much more, and they wouldn’t give a cent to the government, nor would the government ask them too.

And yes, the government never did anything in return for the money they took. Nor will they. The government today is the same as the government yesterday. Increasing taxes is good and yeah our people don’t like to pay shit, but can you trust the people at the top with your money? Plus, it was they who decided to install the broken tax system in the first place. They are responsible. So are we for installing them. So is every Sri Lankan since independence who allowed things to get this bad.

Taxes are necessary. But so are other means of income necessarily to keep the boat floating.

Let's see the real context:

* The entire debate from the pro-Ranil side (because that's what it really is) completely ignores that **many people are fine with tax just not to the Rajapaksa govt** (yes Ranil is a part of that). Bhanuka completely avoids the possibility that his team member simply doesn't want to pay tax to a Rajapaksa govt. This tax debate is an attempt to legitimize Ranil's govt and its going to backfire on us really hard.
* We have already seen them not use our tax money wisely, they ruined the country but even now they raised the defence budget while decreasing the health + food security budget. Addressing corruption absolutely must come first before taxes but these people are trying to convince you that we can skip solving corruption which is actually how we got to this mess in the first place. So this whole ""you can hold them accountable with tax"" argument is complete bullshit
* Assuming we do pay tax to this current govt, then what? We know they're very likely to continue corruption and wasting it and when that does happen then what? Do we hold people like OP accountable? When they use the higher tax to further increase the military budget how will we even protest?
* u/TriAlpha is someone who is consistently pushing whatever Ranil's agenda is at the time, right now that's pitting actual working professionals against each other to shift blame from the govt, and its working, we still have no actual attempt to fix corruption despite it easily being one of the biggest issues
* Using income brackets is an attempt to paint the debate black & white when really the very idea of ""middle-class"" is a grey area in SL. Just because the govt has managed to keep 80% of Sri Lanka poor doesn't mean that earning $500 is ultra-rich. It doesn't make you ultra-poor either but to frame the top 10% as anyone earning 100k+ here and then acting like they are the owners of corporations and part of the 1% elite is disingenuous
* You can be pro-tax but not for this government, the tax debate isn't some armchair black and white thing, you absolutely must take context. I'm pro-tax but no one has been able to justify why the fuck anyone should pay tax to a Rajapaksa govt
* Corporate tax is still cut, if you want to get immediate tax right now look to corporate tax because they owe it to us after their cuts ruined the country, while the middle-class was the only thing keeping this place developed.
* Bhanuka himself earns a ton of money and if income bracket tax suffices he'd proportionally be favored because the taxes disproportionally affect middle-income brackets. If he earns 2 mil while someone earns 1 mil, his tax is far easier to manage. Bhanuka is no shining beacon of philanthropy lmao, he is very much part of the same techbro startup culture that is absolutely failing to keep our programmers here.

This is the problem, this is a narrative that is only vaguely true and misses a huge amount of context, you probably saw those tax:GDP charts right? Well the same people pushing those charts don't show you our GDP:Military:Education:Health ratios either.

Which comes to your second point (why we can't do both), we can't do both because reforming the govt and dealing with corruption comes first and we're not even dealing with corruption so we're not doing both to begin with. No country is perfectly free from corruption but there is clearly a certain level where no matter what you do its next to impossible to develop the country with rampant corruption, higher taxes not only doesn't deal with that issue but it give even less incentive for them to be accountable. How does giving Mahinda free money make him accountable? The proof of this argument is that despite so much push-back on taxes the govt STILL increased the military budget and decreased the health + food security budget, we saw right away that the ""tax will make them accountable"" argument was not true.

I'd suggest reading up on Botswana, a country which had a mildly similar situation which managed to transform to one of the fastest developing African countries in the world, they consistently mention dealing with corruption as one of the main reasons for this.

To me, effect use of the taxes means the government uses the money to fund the government expenditures without having to print money to cover the short fall. It's pretty simple  

The government doesn't make enough cash, so it prints money to cover deficit. If new taxes move, the needle will reduce the inflationary pressure of money printing. That's the effect use of taxes. 

Now you can disagree that's up to you, but to me, that's a great step towards recovery, lol.

Stop deflecting the question and actually answer it. Why would THIS govt be accountable with our tax money? I + many others, again, are NOT AGAINST TAX we are against a CORRUPT GOVT using it. Inflation is still happening and predicted to stay in the double digits for the rest of this year while the Rajapaksa's stolen assets alone are said to equal the IMF bailout, why should working professionals be burdened with the money already stolen from our govt?

Maybe an easier way to explain this is, if a Mahinda supporter told me during Mahinda's time that Mahinda needs higher taxes and he'll put it to good use, you'd be skeptical right? This time is not only similar but even worse because the ones paying the tax aren't the ones who got us here, most of them didn't even vote Rajapaksa and now they are paying for their crimes while they STILL are in parliament",neutral,positive,positive,positive

You're living in a dream world where everything is based on right and wrong, good and bad.

In a dream world, MR would have been arrested for corruption in 2015, and Gota would have been arrested for war crimes in 2010. Instead, our ppl gave them an overwhelming mandate in the last election.

My point is Rajapakses corruption was soo fucking obvious we all knew it for years, in reality 90% of the funds they stole were between 2005 -2015, thsi time there wasnt much for them to work with. but still ppl voted for them because they promised then less taxes and more friendly regulation in 2019 

The ppl didn't care if the Rajapakses stole as long as they got something out of it as well.  How else do you explain why they got soo many fucking votes ?


>Stop deflecting the question and actually answer it. Why would THIS govt be accountable with our tax money? I + many others, again, are NOT AGAINST TAX we are against a CORRUPT GOVT using it.


Look, every government in LK has been corrupt, and any future one will also be corrupt. In a ideal world we raise taxes and cut down spending drastically.

We should cut down our bloated public sector, sell off loss making SOEs, and get rid of half the army but these things will never happen no matter how much I want them to.

For one these things can't happen overnight. For example, it takes at least 5 years to cut the army in half on a realistic time scale. But not a single political party in the entire country is for cutting defense or cutting the public sector for a very simple reason. 

Because they would lose votes. I can keep dreaming about these things happening but in reality it's highly unlikely to ever happen. No matter who is in power. SJB,UNP,SLPP,SLFP,JVP,TNA, it doesn't matter. None of them will do what's necessary. Hence, they will all be corrupt and working for their own interests.

That's why I'm settling for less inflation because I know no matter who's elected, the story may be different but not the tune. 

So let me put the question to you, how do you know that another won't be as corrupt or even more than this one ?

Corruption is in Sri Lankan Nature unfortunately,

An example,


Uniforms of female schoolteachers and students should not change: Palitha Thero (2022)


Responding to the request made by the Ceylon Teachers' Union (CTU) Secretary Joseph Stalin to grant the opportunity to wear suitable, comfortable clothes for female teachers to attend schools, the Nalandaramaya Chief Incumbent Chief Secretary Ven. Palitha Thera said the circular issued in this regard by the Public Administration Ministry on September 27 does not apply to teachers at all.

Addressing the media, he said the CTU Secretary had requested the Education Secretary to allow female teachers the opportunity to follow a more lenient dress code to attend schools.

The prelate mentioned that Sri Lanka is a country with a 2,600-year-old Buddhist culture and identity.

""Buddhist monks, military personnel, police, school teachers and students have unique uniforms. As required by the CTU Secretary and non-government organizations (NGOs), they cannot change the uniforms of teachers or students in the country. ""If that happens, there is bound to be a great disaster,"" he said.

""Even in the Old Testament of the Bible, it is clearly said that women's clothes should be used for women and men's clothes for men without changing, and it is an insult to God. Therefore ignoring this custom could be very disastrous to this country and its culture,"" he said.

Hence, I do not believe Education Minister Susil Premajayantha would allow the change of the uniforms of the teachers and students as per the wishes of external sources, Ven. Palitha said.

He added that the minister would not take any actions to ruin the culture and identity of the country.

And yes they get low wages that's true, but the estates protect it's community of tea pluckers. The estate corporative gives food rations very cheap to compensate for the low wages, they receive free healthcare and protection at the highest priority (each estate has its own ambulance and is given the highest priority when admitted to the local dispensary or hospital).

 And they do have the freedom to leave the estates and find employment wherever they want (currently there's a gradual decline of estate workers as the younger generation have started to join garment factories etc, but they get abused worse over there from what I hear). But if they do leave the estates they have to leave behind the free housing given by the estates and the concessions. This makes them reluctant to find employment elsewhere and prefer being in estate communities. 

And also job security because during the pandemic most of the garment factory workers were laid off but in estates the workers have guaranteed job safety. Besides that the companies constantly try to uplift the standards of living for these people even though it's a slow process. 

These are some of the reasons amongst many others as to why these people stay in estates. 

Also the above picture is a normal sight when the estate lorry goes to town. Heck even I've hitched a ride once or twice. Please do understand that most estate workers live in extremely remote areas of the estate and there are no busses. The only mode of transport is walking, the estate tractor or lorry.

Also the estate workers are more communal and helpful to each other than you can ever imagine. Even domestic violence is not tolerated, there have been times when my father stepped in to solve domestic fights in the estates. 

So if you haven't lived in this community and interacted with actual workers of the estates (not the fellows along the nuwaraeliya main roads begging for your pity saying the estates don't treat them right)  you really shouldn't be judging what you see.

First of all, providing unlimited data isn't simple as you may think. There are infrastructure limitations. Simply put, there is a limit to the bandwidth our current networks can handle. If everyone get unlimited, entire networks will go down.

Now if we turn to the much more practical solution, which is removing peak / off peak limits, we still end up with the same problem. ISPs have already released a statement regarding this. ""Off peak"" data or ""Night time data"" are offered as a bait in order to sell more internet packages. So basically you are paying for your peak data. Offpeak data is given to you for free. This is a marketing trick because average consumers dont use internet during off peak hours. If they remove this limit additional bandwidth could potentially cause issues to our existing networks.

It's important to understand even if they introduce an unlimited package it will be very expensive and average consumers won't be able to pay for that.

Finally, if we need better internet, we simply have to improve our current infrastructure. Currently, Sri Lanka in a unstable situation.  It's up to our leaders and the government to improve these things. Unless our country become politically stable, attract more investors and pay off our debt, I dont see this happening.

That said, we can protest and sign petitions all we want. But it won't improve our current conditions. So, please stop comparing first world countries with us and try to understand why is this happening and what can we do to change this.",negative,negative,neutral,negative

* There are smaller providers that have been around long enough in developed countries that offer fast unlimited (or essentially unlimited) internet at very affordable prices.
* If you shop online at the ISP's website for internet packages, it might look expensive but this might be for several reasons, such as the internet provider might want customers to bundle internet, cable, cellphone etc in one package, or the apartment a person lives in has an agreement with a provider that has been negotiated by the condo association (so the tenant doesn't have a choice). These giant conglomerates still market to the older boomer generation so they try to push cable tv etc. as well.
* The prices seen online aren't always the actual prices a customer can get and better deals are offered. If you walk in to a store or pick up the phone and call, you're usually going to get a better offer. TV ads also show better deals than those online.
* Most middle-class people in developed countries can afford internet packages for unlimited data relative to their income.

In contrast, the other individual earns $320 per week, making her clothing sales tax 2.2 percent of income.

Whether you like it or not, the colour of skins is part of the typical identity of a nation. When you imagine a typical Chinese, you would imagine an Asian ethnic person, not an African ethnic person. I am not saying that black people can't have Chinese nationality or fairer skin people in sri lanka can't be sri Lankan.

Sri Lankan people in general are not that whitened or fairer skins. They have contrasted brown coloured skins.

Plus it  projects the idealised whitened skin colours stereotype.  In African and Asian countries, we have skins colour discrimination where  whitened skin colours people are seen as more beautiful, superior while dark-skin coloured people as inferior or ugly. People with dark skins are discriminated and have low-esteem because of the skin stereotype.",neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

>Religion doesn't have to be in alliance with patriarchy, but it often will, to advance its own power and influence. All major religions have done this, but it doesn't mean that religion and patriarchy is inseparable.

Why do we have to separate religion and patriarchy when we can just remove religious dogma from the equation and just go from there? But when it comes to removing  patriarchy(if you need to) it's a bit hard to do. Even though removing religious dogmas can cause ppl to question authority then which leads to soften patriarchal thinking. Don't you think?

Religious thinking will always hold back progress.!! It's the way of thinking which should be changed. What religions do is holding back people from skeptical and critical thinking. And how can ppl who have gained power through religion can hold back progress to retain in power? If they hold back the progress they lose power. What they do is using religion (and common human errors) furthermore for convincing and deceiving more people to stay in power. So you see? Religion is the problem.!

hgzghtl,t3_q9sh5e,4,0,1634479014.0,Adniwhack,"What you are pointing out is true. Though, I will be the one at the other side of the coin.

Online games are essentially a business, and unlike the old days when the relationship with the game publisher and consumer ends at the point of sale, now you are constantly engaging with the game developers and publishers when you are playing a game. Nowadays, the product sold by the game developers and publishers are not the game, but the consumer. This has resulted in the introduction of predatory mechanics that are being currently under investigation by several other countries and has been likened to gambling.

Couple this with the current trend of digitalization (which has mostly happened), social pressure and the pandemic has increased the attractiveness of video games (put social media to this category also) as an entertainment medium.

Also, game addiction is a real thing, and I believe this is added to DSM-5 recently (I am not a psychologist/psychiatrist, someone can confirm this point for me.) 

Apart from this, these games can create isolation among people, and degrade social interactions. 

What is my message then? Think about the time you spend on online games needlessly. While it is incredibly wrong to pin all blame on video games, being mindful of your usage will indeed help you in the long run.

As a society, I believe we should place more importance on the happiness of the family. 

The truth is, as a third world country, most of us are not in the situation to think about happiness when there is no food on the table. As such, pressure to succeed is a real thing.

But that's what kids play now. Most games on mobile platforms all hook players up to some micro-transaction scam and try to earn that sweet money off of players who want to just win the game. There's games that make it easier for you to win if you pay more for micro-transactions. This is almost cheating and does not stand up to games that you find on other platforms specially on consoles.

The free-to-play games always try to earn something through micro-transactions and its taking a toll on players. Some are good but when you mix business interest with game play it always demeans the game. So best to play stuff you pay upfront, the cheapo mindset of SL parents and lessened control they hold what the child is doing on the phone will lead something bad even if it is not a suicide attempt. Mental illness will explain your hypothesis to a certain extent, but it doesn't explain this new wave of attempts of very small children who the parents say that were ""addicted"" to their phones for a long time, once they were given a phone for studies. Before the govt goes up guns blazing on all online gaming either the gamers will have to update these people on what ""real"" games are and of the pitfalls playing shit or wait till we loose everything because they'll make it worse for everyone.

One of the first foreign celebrities to visit Pakistan after 144 children were killed by terrorists in Peshawar was Sanath Jayasuriya. Pakistanis had this idea that Sri Lanka stands with us through thick and thin.

Now the appeasement of these extremists has led to this. Us completely shitting on the one friendship we thought we had in the region.

The last time this group rioted, it led to 8 dead policemen Then the government made a deal with the group which lead to the release of their leader. Everyone said the police will not stop anyone the next time this group strikes. Lo and behold.

We deserve this international condemnation to be honest. No two ways around it. There is a limit to appeasement. We had the Taliban land mafia taking over land and killing kids in the west, and they were being appeased with brand new roads and free electricity, just so they wouldn't attack again. They attacked over and over again. Our governments don't learn.

Ever since this attack there has been an influx of right wing Indians on this sub and they have taken over the conversation to peddle a very specific agenda. One that isn’t pluralist but rather perhaps even more myopic in the other direction.

I wholeheartedly agree with you that the entirety of South Asia is plagued with structural issues that breeds extremism and religious fervor to mask the sheer incompetence and hopelessness of our populace.

However I don’t believe you need to make an equivalence between Sri Lanka and Pakistan, by all human development indexes Sri Lanka far suppresses us. And as a nation we Pakistanis need to seriously figure out where we have went wrong as a nation to be in the place we are now. This incident is extremely shameful and everyone in the nation feels this shame currently.

What we need from Sri Lankan’s is patience and pressure to help us solve our issues. Please stand by your government as they hold Pakistan accountable.

On 6 November, the President addressed the media, where he spoke of the appointment.
“I gave the chancellor position to Ananda Thera. The monk helped this Government to come to power. He made contributions from the time of President Mahinda Rajapaksa. However, due to some reasons, the monk spoke against us recently. Parliamentarian and President’s Counsel Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, and MP Ranil Wickremesinghe visited the Thera and sought advice. People like Ceylon Teachers’ Union General Secretary Joseph Stalin and Ceylon Teachers’ Service Union General Secretary Mahinda Jayasinghe also went to seek advice. They all went to the Thera seeking advice but when the Thera becomes the Chancellor, they say that it is not appropriate,” said the President.

Ah, Sirisena. The most reliable source there is. 

>Sri Lanka’s non-alignment is nothing new,

>it’s actually the Rajapakses that are dragging us to China and abandoning our traditional allies (Japan with the LRT, India & Japan with the Colombo port terminal deal).

You mean the same Japan that ""gifted"" us broadcast television under the express terms that we buy their shitty outdated TV sets and their shitty outdated TV sets **ONLY** and the same India that's being eyeing Sri Lanka ever since 1948? If they are our ""traditional allies"" then we are fucked.


>I don’t know much about Ukraine but from what I’ve heard Zelenskyy is more pro-russian and centrist than any of their other leaders.

Saying Zelensky is ""pro-Russian"" is like saying Sirisena is a dependable source. Oh wait...

>It wasn’t him who chose their foreign policy,

It was Zelensky that started acting out the ""will they, won't they"" trope in terms of Ukraine's NATO membership. Dude was gullible enough to be duped by the Pentagon and NATO, who's only goal was to sanction the shit out of Russia at the expense of Ukraine if need be.

>Also we don’t have to be physically and militarily be invaded when Rajapakses have made sure that we become an economically dependent colony of three foreign powers.

Evidently not according to the Budapest Memorandum. You can't expect Russia to sit by and watch while a cold war era organization founded explicitly on anti-russian sentiment set up thermobaric missiles on it's front yard. You better look up how the US reacted when the USSR tried to do the same in 1962 with another fellow sovereign state; Cuba.

>Same thing happened in 2014, Putin tried to stop Ukraine joining the EU, which led to a revolution against their Russian backed president.

So Yanukovych's administration is ""Russian backed"" but the ones that followed the coup are not US/NATO backed? Lol at the hypocrisy.

>What exactly is your solution by blaming Zelensky? Become a puppet state of Russia?

hzb49w7,t1_hzb0k2z,27,1,1646396741.0,manulapamuditha,"saw your post asking about him cause you are an immigrant child of Sri Lankan parents. I'm running a bit late today, so I'll explain in brief and some others might add the things I might forget  


**- Dirty politics here!**  
He appoints the people he wants to the positions which play a critical role in law enforcement. He made the court (Supreme, maybe. Don't wanna get arrested like Ranjan) release many people after making them relieved of all the accusations including criminals and the people responsible for the Easter Sunday attack.  


**- Shitty ruling**  
!He came to the election like a superhero and have no experience in politics. When some students in a school told him ""Our computers are broken, we separated parts and checked 2 out of 5"" his answer was ""Didn't you check the other 3?""

&#x200B;

**- Excessive expenses for media attention**  
He goes from village to village to know about the problems faced by rural people. It was something he planned to do for a while, but I can't remember it very much. He goes there and speaks with people about their problems. Just because he comes, stages and other facilities are arranged for him, which can be used for the betterment of the villages.

  
**- Autocratic behaviour**  
Once he was out in an above kind of a programme where he was told about an issue about not getting something provided to people by the government by a village woman. Then the president asked an officer responsible for that sector and he said all of it was provided and no more stocks. (Or something like that, anyway, the point was she was not given because of not allocating enough) Then the president told him to give it and the officer told him that he needs a circular to do it. Then the president said **Whatever I say is a circular.**

\[I can remember a comment by my History teacher about that incident. He said the people were stupid to clap when he said that (People clapped when the president said that) He said ""What if a secretory comes to the president when he's raging with anger and ask him for a sign?"" The president might lose it and say ""Stuff it in your a$$"" and then the teacher said ""Whatever he says is a circular and that man must literally do it!""\]

&#x200B;

**- Releasing Dumind Silva**  
Hiru TV owner's brother Duminda silva was released from prison with special presidential powers. He was sentenced to death because of a murder. It was done in public and yet released him cause his brother's TV channel helped Gota during his presidential campaign a lot.(And yet, they kept Ranjan Ramanayaka in prison for speaking out the truth)

  
**- Destroying economy**  
When he came to power, 1 USD was worth 170-180 SLR, but now it's about 200$. They wasted dollars we had on useless projects from which they can take a commission and gave those dollars to their business friends at a lower rate through government banks. And they pointed out so many rupee notes making the value of the SLR go down making the inflation increase by 15% as of today. And then started distributing that newly printed money to people during covid to cover up their failure.

&#x200B;

**- Treating best friends with special privileges.**  
 A tax of Rs.50.00 per kg is charged from the imported sugar. When his friends imported sugar one time, he lowered the tax to Rs.00.25 *(25 cents or the previous tax divided by 200 or 0.5% of the previous tax )* And then his friends were able to sell sugar at the same old rate giving them an extra profit of Rs.49.75 per every kilogramme of sugar.

**- 20th amendments of the constitution**  
They got 2/3 power in the parliament and made changes to the parliament giving the president more powers and making the law enforcement sector politically vulnerable.some interesting facts  
= Presidents transactions and expenses can not be investigated anymore  
= President could appoint supreme court judges before, but couldn't remove them. With the new amendment, he can appoint and fire them both. *(It's the god mode baby!)*

**- Taking a big sum of dollars from Sri Lanka to Nigeria (Unconfirmed)**  
This is unconfirmed as they had no comments. Recently Mahinda R went to Thirupadi kovil to take blessings as he is one of the best and well-known Buddhists in Sri Lanka. He used a private jet provided by a businessman friend to go there. They say that [about 102 tons of printed paper was taken to Uganda](https://www.sundaytimes.lk/210418/news/sla-uplifts-102-tons-of-printed-material-to-uganda-but-refuses-to-give-details-440509.html) in that plane. They say it was just printed paper. I'm sure he wasn't going to start a press in Uganda with those papers. I'm sure they are not going to steal all the dollars from poor people like us.

These are some of the reasons why we hate him, not to mention the electricity, fuel problems.  
Had some more things to mention, but I'm really running late now.

Now it's more chill. Staying long in one place, we work remotely, so, we can't be in the road constantly. 

The power cuts and fuel shortage didn't affect us that much. Now we are moving less and using more PickMe and Uber rather than public transportation.

We gotta rely more on the 4G (we got SLT) and do hotspot when power cuts happen. 

I don't see much how the power cuts can affect vacacion tourist or travelers since they are mostly outside exploring. 

If I have to say one inconvenience, it would be when the power cut is at night, moskito time, and it's hot. Working editing video on a laptop with no fan it's not good at all.
Besides that, we are having a great time in Sri Lanka and trying to show that and attract as many tourists as possible. 
The country now is open enough and covid restrictions are close to none, so, time to welcome and attract some foreign people to discover or enjoy again this beautiful country.

The problem is not a food shortage *( for some imported food items, it is )* but the inflation that makes it hard for people. 

You won't have trouble finding food here as the problem we locals have is LP gas and the higher price of food items. Most of the food items you guys might consume will still be available as they don't consume LP gas as much as the preparation of our local food items does.

The best advice I can give you is to come here and DO NOT EXCHANGE ALL YOUR MONEY to SL Rupees. *( Kind of feel like I betrayed my country, but I should tell you the truth )* LKR is very unstable right now and you can keep your money with you as Dollars or Euros or Sterling Pounds *( Unless any type of those currencies is not accepted here. As far as I know they are )*. Then you can check the exchange rate at the moment and buy things with those currencies and receive the change in Rupees. It is the wisest thing I know that a foreigner coming here can do.

The reason is, the rupee is going down very fast making records! A few days ago, 1 USD = Rs. 260 and then today, it's Rs. 284. So keep them with you and only spent when you need them. Otherwise, if you exchange all of the money you have to LKR and spend them and then exchange the rest back to your currency, you might have lost 10-15% of your money because of the instability of the LKR.

Before covid restrictions, I bought a loaf of bread for Rs. 60 and now it's Rs. 120. The minimum charge for a bus trip was Rs. 10 and now it's Rs. 20. An egg was Rs. 17 and now it's Rs. 35. So be careful like an investor in the stock market whenever you exchange your money to LKR because the government have emptied their treasury and is now printing out new notes without realizing it just devalues the LKR. *( Under the supervision of the seven brains brother of the warrior* \[ You'll get to know him when you come here. LOL! \] *)*  
*Printing notes in that way made a paper shortage in the country and the government had to announce that they don't have enough papers to print papers for school exams!* \- **Just a meme I read, those two are not related ( Or are they? ) except for the fact that there's a paper shortage and the government is bringing notes worth billions of Rupees each week.**

Although port operations started in 2011, following the completion of phase one of the project, Hambantota port was still incurring losses by 2016. According to the submissions made to a Parliament committee, the accumulated losses of Hambantota port was 46.7 billion Sri Lankan rupees (approximately $300 million) as of the end of 2016, just before the port was leased to CM Port.

Chinese loans were often at high rates. The first phase of the Hambantota port project was a $307 million loan at 6.3 percent interest. Multilateral development banks typically offer loans at rates closer to 2 or 3 percent, and sometimes even closer to zero. One reason China is successful in locking in these higher rates is that better alternatives are often unavailable. Another reason is that Chinese loans, while often requiring the partner to use Chinese contracts, are not as stringent in their requirements for safeguards and reforms.

The port is still not profitable and wont be profitable in the near future which is called white elephant.

Looting that happened during George Floyd protests are overblown to be honest. US right wing wants to highlight looting and riots to take the focus away from the real protests. BLM was a great concept in the beginning. However, the leaders of BLM were corrupt. That was really the downfall. They stole so much of the money that was donated and I think one is even in trouble with the law currently because she purchased like 3 mansions from the donated money. 

BLM protests were completely different too, though. They too thought having a hashtag would get their message home. It did to the extent that all the corporations started using #BLM in their tv ads for rest of the year. It didn't bring any real change because they were too focused on being black and alienating other poor working class demographics. I'm not denying that African Americans and latinos face more challenges than other races but if they had concentrated less on identity politics but more on class politics, I think the results would have been a little different. 

Look up Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. It was an area in Seattle that was occupied by BLM protestors like what's currently happening in Galle Face. Needless to say, it didn't do anything. People just went home after a while.

And no it's not an offence punishable by law 


There are two types of offences in the Sri lankan penal system (or rather any penal system) 
 Non statutory offences and statutory offences 

Non statutory offences are your regular day to day crimes where they look into the physical element of the crime and the mental element of the crime 

For an example in a case of murder the court will look into factors like why did the person commit it. If the accused can show factors like self defence (thus showing no ill will) then you can literally get away with zero consequences. 

Statutory offences are offences where they don't look at the intention but rather the simple fact of commiting that action itself is sufficient

An example would be having sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 16

She might have given explicit consent, you might even have her giving consent on video, she might come to court and give evidence on your behalf that it was voluntary but none of this matters 

The simple fact of commiting it itself is sufficient to get you 20 years in prison 


So in the above case of op, displaying the eelam flag in a post like this is not necessarily a statutory offence, thus his intention matters. 


Also I'm not too sure as to whether the displaying of the flag it self is an offence, but nevertheless even if it is 

It's immaterial",neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

>making fun of LTTE people

It's a joke comparing Prabha (who is a terrorist btw, not some messiah who people should venerate, even so, everyone makes fun of religious figures, have you seen the internet my guy?) to Mario lol how is that making fun of LTTE people? I don't see anyone getting butthurt over  memes about Gota or anyone. Making fun of the actual soldiers would indeed be triggering to people, but this is Prabha lol, a terrorist leader by admission of everyone except racist Eelam sympathizers. You saying we should be walking around on eggshells when it comes to Prabhakaran? Most in this thread is only talking about how accurate and funny the physical comparison is. I don't see how this could be taken as making fun of LTTE people. Boy I sure hope you don't see any memes about that angry moustache model from Germany.

So in short, this isn't considered making fun of Tamils, or the LTTE soldiers and its perfectly fine to make fun of Prabha, make as many jokes about Sinhala leaders as much as you want! So either you either failed to grasp this simple notion, or you have a soft spot for good old Prabha (whats another phrase for that? hmmmm).

But let's not kid ourselves. There are ulterior motives at play here. Namely, the elephant in the room; China. If India didn't step up, China would've been free to go on a shopping spree buying up strategic points from which they could gain a formidable foothold in the Indian Ocean. And again, we are grateful to India irrespective of its motives because in the end, it was a win-win for both India in the long-term and Sri Lanka in the short-term. If you really do need a pat on the back for all this, consider this it.

Now onto the Aussies...they came for a tour at a time when we are at our lowest. We barely had the ability to keep the lights on. The Aussie Team coming here managed to garner us a spotlight in communicating our plight to the world. The players actively boosted our tourism industry which would help us in the long-term to increase our pathetic forex reserves. In the end, we thanked them for their contribution in a way that we could. Not to mention, this was a huge PR boost in and of itself (you should see the Aussies in Australia creaming their pants). If even a fraction of them decide to come here because of this spectacle, it'd be a huge win.

And let's be honest; India and Sri Lanka have a love/hate relationship. Like siblings do. But these are not siblings but nation-states. In the end, both have to work towards what's beneficial for themselves. The only difference is, unlike India, Sri Lanka doesn't have the luxury of having politicians who care even one iota about the country itself.

They are still in belief that tourism will save this country. I was astonished at how the tamilnadu government was able to liberalize many sectors even with government subsidies.

Sri Lanka has not yet violated any single one of the NAM stipulations when it comes to foreign wars. Did the administration back then favor Pakistan? Maybe.

First read your very own Deepinder Singh's ***The IPKF in Sri Lanka*** and then we'll talk about genocide on ethnic Tamils.

As much as there were times ('71 and '89) where the Sinhalese people lost their freedoms and rights, there has been a long systemic and systematic loss of rights for the minorities. The modern assault on these rights and freedoms can be said to have started with Anagarika Dharmapala, and has continued to this day.  


Pointing out a few years of lack of rights does not compare favourably against the literal decades where minorities lost their rights to jobs, language, education, official documentation in a language they can understand, or even a national anthem they could understand.  


so, yes, u/Gamerindreams, I HAVE heard of the 70s uprising, my father and uncles were caught up in it. and yes, u/xCuri0 and u/LankanFD6917, it happened in 89 and in Rathupaswala, but the majority is only now feeling a small portion of what the minorities suffered. fun fact, after the Rathupaswala shooting, there was one guy on TV asking ""we supported them, why are they treating us like like this?""  


Even in this sub there were minority folks explaining why the people of the North and East are not showing up in support of GotaGoGama and \\#gotagohome.

igaac8n,t1_ig8zz1a,8,3,1657904383.0,ISBagent,"Sri Lanka has to build tall not wide and because of that we need to focus on quality not quantity.
To do this, more hydraulics must first need to be restored in order to optimize the water distribution for agricultural and industrial energy consumption that will come should do the following to jumpstart ourselves in the short term:

- Straighten out the agricultural industry and diversify the produce for later expansion while also ensuring our domestic market is served as the primary customer before the international market.
- Regulate the textiles industry to ensure our services are no longer being undercut, and expand the production. A higher quality Agricultural industry will allow higher quality textiles to be produced, thus catering to a different tier of buyer. Textiles is also entirely how Bangladesh jump started its economy.
- Overhaul the education system to be STEM which will become the workhorse of the economy later on. 

For context to STEM, 2 examples:

IT is big in India which accounts for 8% of its GDP (2020), where they produce $45 Billion domestically and $150 Billion in exports from oversees work using a little over half of their 4.5 million tech workers. Compare that to the 2 million Sri Lankan workers mostly working in the servant industry in the Middle East producing $7 Billion in personal remittances (2019) which has dwindled to $1.3 Billion at the beginning of this year.

Another example is Medical, which is big in Philippines and accounts for 8% of Filipino GDP. According to a 2017 report, the combined domestic and oversees work of the medical industry accounted for $31 Billion in GDP for the Philippines.

And for overall GDP context: Florida, a US State, has basically the same total population (Florida 21.2 million, Lanka 21.9 million), and same employed population (Florida 8.49 million, Lanka 8 million), yet produces $1.2 Trillion in GDP per year while we produce $80 Billion in GDP per year... India’s tech industry alone produces nearly twice the amount our entire country produces. If Florida was a sovereign state, it would be ahead of Indonesia in GDP. Florida’s agricultural industry accounts for a small portion of that GDP, which is heavy on finance, professional services, enterprise, education and health, and trade (retail, wholesale, manufacturing). It’s natural resource output is less than its agricultural output which accounts for $6.3 Billion of its GDP, meaning if we get STEM right on the long term, we will have no need to even touch our natural resources or even agricultural industry to produce a strong and powerful economy.

Oh and if you’re a train geek, Floridas Brightline Rail project is linking Miami to Jacksonville which is the same distance as Galle to Jaffna. Miami to West Palm beach is the same distance as Galle to Colombo, and West Palm Beach to Orlando is roughly the same distance as Colombo to Kandy.

Your comment shows that you are both historically and economically illiterate. Colonies exist for the economic benefit of the mother country and are useless unless they help to achieve profit. The mother nation should draw raw materials from its possessions and sell them finished goods, with the balance favoring the European country. The colonies also gave the mother country an outlet for exports, which increased jobs and industrial development at home. But none of this would happen if the colonies traded with countries other than their mother, which is why Britain took legal steps to force its colonists to buy and trade only with England. The British began regulating colonial trade to maximize profits under the mercantilist system in the 1660s. The King forbade direct exportation to rival markets. For example, tobacco from Jamestown had to be shipped to England first, where it could be taxed, before it could be sent on and sold elsewhere. 

The end product would be that capital from it's colonies are transferred to the colonial power, thus making England richer. An example is the plunder of Bengal, which directly contributed to the Industrial Revolution in Britain. The capital amassed from Bengal was used to invest in British industries such as textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution and greatly increase British wealth, while at the same time leading to de-industrialization in Bengal.",neutral,negative,positive,neutral

inqr1sd,t1_inq0a2n,4,1,1662740045.0,ISBagent,"Lanka was far from being ‘stone age’. Lanka was advanced in Romes time and remained so up until the Portuguese invasion. In 50AD when it was rediscovered by a Roman Tax ship sailed astray, Emperor Claudius was shocked to learn that Lanka during the Anuradhapura Kingdom was not only better urbanized than Rome, but also as advanced in its Hydraulics infrastructure as Rome, Egypt, and Babylonnia. The Sinhalese of that time whom the Romans began trading with were detailed as being a noble peoples of Buddhist Dharma who enjoyed immense wealth and plentiful foods, where the average person enjoyed the delicacy’s of a King and the King lived as an average person. The Imperial Court did not like the Roman people learning about Anuradhapura State Craft, as it came on the heels of Neros suicide. Lanka during this period was ruled by an elected Monarchy which the people themselves were allowed to reject in the event the King fails to uphold the Dasaviddha Rajadhama- the 10 precepts of Kingship set forth by Buddha. 

Furthermore, Sri Lankan trade was widely sought after. The Somali’s traded Sri Lankan cinnamon with the rest of the world, keeping their Sri Lanka source a secret so that they could monopolize the trade. Textiles and spice sourced from Tamils in Jaffna were making its way into the Silk Road and selling for considerable coinage. The Sinhalese metallurgy was such that the Abassayid Caliphate traded mainly with Sri Lanka when it came to metal based products. 

The military might of Lanka overall was also an anomaly compared to the rest of the subcontinent. Because the Kingdoms of Lanka built tall rather than wide as they were confined to an Island- unlike our Indian counterparts- many aspects to society were advanced at a much more rapid pace, this included the military. Combat training, tactics, and weaponry were much more refined, advanced, and of higher quality than that of the kingdoms of India. And the constant infighting that occurred during the medieval period between the Sinhalese and Tamils meant that there were no short supply of seasoned and experience fighters. While the purpose and efficiency of of militaries would changed based on Kingdoms and Kings, overall the Sri Lankan’s were not the ones foreign kingdoms risked invading in ancient times unless confident. 

This hesitation to fuck with Lanka was emphasized during the Kingdom of Polonaruwa, where Parakramabahu the Great pushed out the Cholas, sacked and ruled over Burma, saved and ruled over Pandya, and established colonies in what is now West Bengal India, Gujarat India, and Gwadar Pakistan- combined creating the greatest extent of Lanka’s historical reach. It would not be inflated to say that the Kingdom of Polonaruwa had the capability and man power to conquest a substantial amount of the Indian subcontinent if the King ignored his Consulars.

The Colonial Christian invasions that started with the Portuguese did catch the Sinhalese and Tamils by surprise, as they were quite effective in the beginning due to experience of conquesting other lands. But Tikiri Bandara who later became Rajasinha I of the Sitiwaka Kingdom was able to counter the Portuguese and decimate the captaincy, killing 1,200 in one battle alone. Overall 6,000 Portuguese across 12 Battalions led by the Cortez types failed in conquesting Lanka, a stunning defeat for the Portuguese and their SMOM handlers.

As for the British, they learned the level of who they were dealing with when they found that the inside of the gun barrels used by Kandyan troops had something British guns did not at the time- spirals in the insides of the barrels to induce spin on the bullet when flying in the air, enhancing accuracy. Modernization is often convoluted with westernization. Much of what made the modernization of humanity possible came from non western countries. The Kingdom of Kandy would endure multiple invasions of the British while simultaneously maintaining a stable economy via trade. The British had to resort to garrisoning its troops and destroy hydraulic infrastructure which in turn destroyed the crops, inducing a famine which decimated both sides. By that time both sides were desperate, yet still persistent. What pivot the war into British favor and changed everything was Sri Vikram Rajasinha turning into a drunkard and adulterer, resulting in him falling out of social and political favor of the people and the Kandyan nobility. The nobility were convinced by the British that they’d have a place among King Georges court if they flipped sides. The Kandyan nobility as a result sacked Sri Vikram Rajasinha and signed a treaty with the British. The British then sacked the nobility and replaced them with a new Bandara’s who were not leaders, but followers. The descendants of these followers took charge of the ‘independent’ government and ran it all into the fucking ground creating the mess we have today. Look at the succession of Presidents and Prime Ministers since Queen Elizabeth and you will see a Pattern where less than 10 families all linked to each other have held the power. 

Also, in regards to modernization/Westernization, yes the British did provide Lanka with rail line infrastructure, and reconfigured the provincial lines and statecraft to enhance certain aspects of government. But they did not repair the hydraulic infrastructure that 2,500 years worth of Kings built as they saw no use in it, they destroyed the agricultural diversity and by extension the highland environment in order to ramp up tea production which has became the main commodity Lanka is dependent on to function, they stole all of our Gold/Gems/Artifacts, they branded our Pre-History as ‘myth’, and they attempted to erode and replace  the Hindu/Vedic culture and Sanatan/Buddha Dharma that made us who we are with their Christian Ity (Masonic State)- branding any who didn’t accept their God and their way as “Dharmic Savages”. This all led to the Uva Rebellion and later on support for the Reich and Imperial Japan, which resulted in the British to take a far step back and have a more lassie fair approach over its governance of Lanka. But don’t think that their fuckery stopped after ‘independence’. The British ‘modernization’ and westernization of Lanka came at the expense of everyone and everything else and continues as we speak.",neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

Education was still only kept for the elite and was done mostly in English, the average Sinhala or Tamil person who didn't know English were effectively kept out of the education system and out of government positions too. And schools were basically indoctrination camps rather than schools, that's why they were interested in education if they had any interest in educating our people in the first place. Dependency on English, superiority of the British crown, colonial mentaily and the loyalty to the British crown were smoothly put into children's mind at a young  age.  A recent post on this sub showed a poem from colonial days that school children had to learn, which has basically teaching how children should be good loyal subjects of the Crown and how amazing and great the King was.

Again I specifically addressed this in my previous post above 

1. All British aren't responsible for colonisation. 
2. The Queen want the queen when we were colonised 
3. By that logic we should hate the entire monarch  and the British governments even tho neither one that exists today is responsible  for that happend. That's like blaming today's German government for the Nazis lol 

Ps. 
At the end of the day your mentality is the reason why LK is where it is today. Sri Lankan superiority and ego is the reason we are a failed state. 
  
This mentality is exactly why 6.9mil ppl voted for Gota, this mentality is exactly why we have such high ethnic tension in the country. Its time to face the fact that for 75 years Sri Lanka is still a developing country because of ppl like you. I bet your a gota voter lol

Hate to break it to you but we are stupid. Our ppl are world class fools. 

In 2019, a majority of ppl voted for Gota. His platform had a few key points

1. Anti Western (Anti IMF) - Pro China Foreign Policy
2. Keeping Interest Rates Low 
3. Reducing Taxes 
4. Homegrown solutions and protectionist foreign/trade policy 

All of which was the reason he won the election. Anyone with a brain knew that this was a recipe for disaster. Yet a overwhelming majority voted for him because of those key points.

During the early stages it was very profitable that it was done by private companies like the east India company, the crown took over from the company because they were making a lot of money.

Also from my initial comment; 
> The mother nation should draw raw materials from its possessions and sell them finished goods, with the balance favoring the European country. The colonies also gave the mother country an outlet for exports, which increased jobs and industrial development at home.

They could use them to build industries at home, but that would require more capital which they didn't have. So they became resource economies entirely depending on exporting raw materials.

What I meant by the last point is that the globalized system which is new meant that industrialized countries don't need to waste money on maintaining colonies when the globalized markets did transfer capital away from the former colonies. Why spend a lot of money on troops and infrastructure to keep them, when markets can do that to you? A good proof for this is that countries that colonial powers that couldn't form neocolonial structures often held tightly to their colonies, such as Portugal for example as [explained by a historian here](https://research.unl.pt/ws/portalfiles/portal/3628524/PedroAiresOliveiraDecolonizationPortugueseAfrica.pdf):

How does that change anything, she is a direct beneficiary of her families colonisation and when she was asked to repeatedly to disavow atrocities committed by the throne she refused. Also, she never let go of the colonies out of the goodness of her heart, she did so because she had no other choice and refused to return any of the artifacts stolen by the throne back to the colonies.

It will be a very small part of the book I am writing about Medieval Sri Lanka, the fall of the Cholan Empire and the rise of the Kingdom of Kandy.

I just try to look at things observationally and I try not to take the past personally.

I think Sri Lanka would have done fine without British Influence. But they would likely be in a disadvantaged position in a few areas for much longer.

The question really is simple.

Did the British leave Sri Lanka with more universities, a more literate population, a bigger middle class, involved them more heavily in world trade, provide exposure to modern technology such as electricity, scientific knowledge and infrastructure. The answer is YES.

Self sufficiency is fine. But all modern economies need to combine both.

Cash crops and mass production bring in more money.

They will always be prioritised by any developing or developed country than a small trade and barter economy.

And when the new government took over in 1948, they inherited those structures. That is a GOOD inheritance and gave Sri Lanka the same advantage that Singapore had in the 20th century. A country more modern than most of its neighbours and peers.

I'm really happy you know about the Muslim/Catholic Refugees of the 18th century. Sri Lanka was almost always at least 2 or 3 separate kingdoms at any one time. There was on and off war between the Tamil Arya Chakravarti of Jaffna and Singhalese Kings of Kotte. But there was also on and off trade and peace. There was likewise a lot of conflict between the Kingdom of Kotte and Kandy, both Singhalese anyway. Point is the country always struggled with unity. Most countries do. This is normal. Just look at  medieval Scotland and England etc or Egypt and Sudan. Very normal.

But regarding the divide and rule strategy, it was not a legal policy. Just a practice. of employing the most educated. The Jaffna Tamils had better universities. OFC It lead to public resentment. 50% of educated jobs were held by Tamils who were about 20-30%% of the population. That's not fair, but at that point, it was still peaceful and fixable.

The Singhalese Colombo elites were still the wealthiest and most educated. By 1948 the education gap could have been FIXED then and there with time, effort, patience, forgiveness and planning.  Reconciliation is always the first act of nation building.

The British allowed free elections in 1948. The Singhalese majority still formed the majority government and held the power to make the changes necessary to improve the lives of both Tamils and Singhalese. There was a chance there to make things BETTER. But Bandaranaike decided to allow the mobs of protestors to kill hundred to thousands of innocent Tamils in the streets for DECADES to grow his own power. Divide and rule was unjust, but it could have been fixed.

It was about 150 years of colonization. What could've happened during that time is a big ""what-if"". The whole world evolved during that time.

We are no longer talking about Sri Lanka now.
But anyway.

Not sure if you realise.
That ALL those problems you mentioned pre dated the British period.
They may have worsened under British influence, but they were all ready violent and there was a history of bloodshed before and long after the British were there.

European Jews were coming in large numbers by 1882/3 during the Ottoman period. 
More than 40 years prior to the British rule of Palestine.

They were not well received at all by the locals at any time.
Ethnic divide between Jews and Arabs created to parralel societies.

In fact there were so many riots, massacres and attacks on Jewish settlements by Palestinians Arabs in the 1910s the Jews formed a paramilitary defence force called the Harshomer for the sole purpose of stopping Arab insurgents from killing them.

Things got worse in the 1930s and 1940s in the  Holocaust because millions of Jews left Europe for Palestine, leading to a full scale war once the British army  left in 1947/48.

The India and Pakistan conflict predates anything the before and existed long after the British.


https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_massacres_in_India
Have a look at the list of massacres in the  1600s-1700s, 50 to 100 years before the British established themselves firmly in India.
And you will read all about how the Mughals, Sikhs, Marathas and Northern Tribals/ ""Afghans"" from modern Pakistan massacred each other in the 1000s to 400 000+  numbers killed. It was not peaceful when the British arrived. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_massacres_in_India

The British rule in India was cruel and unjust.
Borderline evil in many cases.
But don't forget the British only controlled 60% of the Indian population, the other 40% was run by the locals Rajas.
These local Rajas were just as violent as the British in suppressing their enemies.

By the 1920s to 1940s, the Muslim league and various Hindu communities gained power and perpetrated their own violence before and after independence.

What the British and also the local princely Rajas in Rajastan are guilty of is trying to stop and delay the democratic independence movement by any means possible.
They targeted both Hindus and Muslims meetings of different states and ethnicities.
They didn't care how many they killed on either side.
There was no favouritism.

https://www.indiastudychannel.com/resources/174489-A-painful-chapter-of-Indian-history-The-Mangarh-massacre-1913.aspx

This lead to massacres like Mangarh Rajastan Massacre (1913) where indian troops from the British army and troops from the local Rajas army opened fire on democratic meetings killing 1500 people at a political rally.
The British did the same thing alone at Amritsar (1919) and in Gujarat (1922) with similar numbers.

Meanwhile in other parts of India, there was massacres of 10,000 Hindus and Muslims in Kerela (1921).
Nothing to do with the British, it started as a dispute between peasants and landlords.
Then religious groups got involved and it became Muslim vs Hindu problem. Ethnic and religious violence also took place in Calcutta (1946) where political Muslim and Hindu parties encouraged genocide of each other on ethnic grounds.
These events happened co currently to the British and Rajas suppressing Independence protests by shooting them.

Once the British army left in 1947, the Muslim league and the new majority Hindu government took the guns and the massacres didn't stop for 10 years.
They say a few million died.

In short, many of these countries were experiencing violence and division before, during and after the British rule.

British rule in  Sri Lanka didn't have the problems or massacres that British rule in India had.
It was mostly peaceful up until Bandaranike in the 1950s.

Pity you guys don't want to talk more about Sri Lanka.

1. I think India has a history of near constant famines.
Millions dying.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine_in_India

Under Maratha and Mughal rule, even hundreds of years before millions died regularly.
This indicated the problem was really endemic to the geography.

The Famine in Bengal 1943 was a result of crop failure, cyclone and definitely corruption from the British admin, but it's was not a genocide. 
Academic studies are very clear on that.

The same thing happened in Ireland 1845.
Yes, the British mismanaged both.
But there was enough pre existing conditions for a disaster. Not to mention the British ended the Famine in 1944 anyway.

2. I think most of what Tucker said was actually true, but alot of what Prasanth said was also true.
Nobody can agree that the British did not build the infrastructure, the schools, the transportation, and provided the ground works for a great legal system. Alot of that was used to bring wealth to the upper class, the ruling rajas and ofc the British admin.

3. The India Pakistan conflict is really the fault and responsibility of the Indians and the Pakistanis themselves. 
The bloke who drew the map Cyril Radcliffe was asked by Indian and Pakistani leaders to do.
The British were seen as a third party.

In short, they were fighting when the British got there and they were fighting when thr British left.

I don't have to mention that India had not been united completely for hundred of years.
Before that there was constantly wars and periods of peace followed by more wars.

It's wasn't ""paradise"".

io3c1zs,t1_io2la9l,6,1,1662963181.0,gifispronouncedgif,"The main takeaways from this tournament are Kusal Mendis' and Rajapakse's newfound form in t20is. Rajapakse averages like 70 this asia cup. He has a floating role, and is able to build an innings or slog at the death. He is the most vital batsmen in our team, because as this asia cup showed, if others fail he can still get it on, as his role overlaps with death powerhitters as well as top order accumulators. Moreover Kusal Mendis upping his strike rate as an opener is glorious and pairs really well with Nissanka's measured approach.

This new fearless cricket is what SL really needed, this is what SL have always been about since we started playing. 

Dds played some brilliant shots like friggin A\* drives, but im still not sure if he's the right man in the t20 wc in Aus with big boundaries. I want to see Asalanka back in form hopefully, since dds cant bowl spin overs in Aus.

Hasaranga was able to get wickets this match due to the run rate pressure, thats where he does best, when he's got a nice score to defend. My issue is that he hasnt been that good against the other sides. He needs to use his legspinner more often cos batsmen will just defend the googly otherwise.

Anyways I need not point out the good captaincy by Dasun Shanaka who's had to really learn a lot on the job. You can see his evolution from 2021 wc to nowadays, he's far more mature. He was always willing to learn and adapt and I said back then he'd be one of our best captains cos of this. His batting will be key as well, of course.",positive,positive,positive,positive

The history you hear about people
