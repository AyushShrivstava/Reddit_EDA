You're living in a dream world where everything is based on right and wrong, good and bad.

In a dream world, MR would have been arrested for corruption in 2015, and Gota would have been arrested for war crimes in 2010. Instead, our ppl gave them an overwhelming mandate in the last election.

My point is Rajapakses corruption was soo fucking obvious we all knew it for years, in reality 90% of the funds they stole were between 2005 -2015, thsi time there wasnt much for them to work with. but still ppl voted for them because they promised then less taxes and more friendly regulation in 2019 

The ppl didn't care if the Rajapakses stole as long as they got something out of it as well.  How else do you explain why they got soo many fucking votes ?


>Stop deflecting the question and actually answer it. Why would THIS govt be accountable with our tax money? I + many others, again, are NOT AGAINST TAX we are against a CORRUPT GOVT using it.


Look, every government in LK has been corrupt, and any future one will also be corrupt. In a ideal world we raise taxes and cut down spending drastically.

We should cut down our bloated public sector, sell off loss making SOEs, and get rid of half the army but these things will never happen no matter how much I want them to.

For one these things can't happen overnight. For example, it takes at least 5 years to cut the army in half on a realistic time scale. But not a single political party in the entire country is for cutting defense or cutting the public sector for a very simple reason. 

Because they would lose votes. I can keep dreaming about these things happening but in reality it's highly unlikely to ever happen. No matter who is in power. SJB,UNP,SLPP,SLFP,JVP,TNA, it doesn't matter. None of them will do what's necessary. Hence, they will all be corrupt and working for their own interests.

That's why I'm settling for less inflation because I know no matter who's elected, the story may be different but not the tune. 

So let me put the question to you, how do you know that another won't be as corrupt or even more than this one ?
