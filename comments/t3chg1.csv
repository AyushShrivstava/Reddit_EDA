Ah, Sirisena. The most reliable source there is. 

>Sri Lanka’s non-alignment is nothing new, 

So was Ukraine's...until it wasn't, courtesy of the ""comedian that became a Leader"".

>it’s actually the Rajapakses that are dragging us to China and abandoning our traditional allies (Japan with the LRT, India & Japan with the Colombo port terminal deal).

You mean the same Japan that ""gifted"" us broadcast television under the express terms that we buy their shitty outdated TV sets and their shitty outdated TV sets **ONLY** and the same India that's being eyeing Sri Lanka ever since 1948? If they are our ""traditional allies"" then we are fucked.


>I don’t know much about Ukraine but from what I’ve heard Zelenskyy is more pro-russian and centrist than any of their other leaders.

Saying Zelensky is ""pro-Russian"" is like saying Sirisena is a dependable source. Oh wait...

>It wasn’t him who chose their foreign policy,

It was Zelensky that started acting out the ""will they, won't they"" trope in terms of Ukraine's NATO membership. Dude was gullible enough to be duped by the Pentagon and NATO, who's only goal was to sanction the shit out of Russia at the expense of Ukraine if need be.

>Also we don’t have to be physically and militarily be invaded when Rajapakses have made sure that we become an economically dependent colony of three foreign powers.

We became a ""economically dependant colony"" the very moment J.R. enacted free-market without ever establishing a balance of trade.",neutral,neutral,negative,neutral

Evidently not according to the Budapest Memorandum. You can't expect Russia to sit by and watch while a cold war era organization founded explicitly on anti-russian sentiment set up thermobaric missiles on it's front yard. You better look up how the US reacted when the USSR tried to do the same in 1962 with another fellow sovereign state; Cuba.

>Same thing happened in 2014, Putin tried to stop Ukraine joining the EU, which led to a revolution against their Russian backed president.

So Yanukovych's administration is ""Russian backed"" but the ones that followed the coup are not US/NATO backed? Lol at the hypocrisy.

>What exactly is your solution by blaming Zelensky? Become a puppet state of Russia?

He's a moron who bungled the balance. There's so many examples of small states surviving and even standing up to superpowers without ever becoming ""puppets"". Cuba, 19th century Iran and Mongolia during the Sino-Soviet split comes to mind. Even Sri Lanka to a lesser degree.",negative,negative,negative,negative
