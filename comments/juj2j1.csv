I am not saying that black people can't have Chinese nationality or fairer skin people in sri lanka can't be sri Lankan.

Sri Lankan people in general are not that whitened or fairer skins. They have contrasted brown coloured skins.

Plus it  projects the idealised whitened skin colours stereotype.  In African and Asian countries, we have skins colour discrimination where  whitened skin colours people are seen as more beautiful, superior while dark-skin coloured people as inferior or ugly.

You are adding the word 'typical' for the betterment of your argument. It's not like we expect the US one to be fat, the Pakistani one to be fully covered, and or the Irish one to be Ginger.",neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

And yeah, I agree with your point as the majority of the population are tan in complexion. Since it’s the OP’s drawing, and they drew it for entertainment purposes, maybe they’re interested in light skinned girls and maybe that’s the reason they made it that way, don’t you think?

But yeah, I agree with you, to represent our country, a tan, Lo-fi Sri Lankan girl for the picture above would be a perfect choice, not gonna lie😎👍",neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral
