China hands out loans without any due diligence. That lack of oversight allows local politicians in that country to pilfer those funds. 

Now, since they're getting so rich off these loans, the local politicians kowtow even more to China. China loves that! Entire cabinet of a sovereign nation is kissing their feet just in exchange for a few billions in loans. So China releases even more funds to bring the country into its camp.

Although port operations started in 2011, following the completion of phase one of the project, Hambantota port was still incurring losses by 2016. According to the submissions made to a Parliament committee, the accumulated losses of Hambantota port was 46.7 billion Sri Lankan rupees (approximately $300 million) as of the end of 2016, just before the port was leased to CM Port.

Chinese loans were often at high rates. The first phase of the Hambantota port project was a $307 million loan at 6.3 percent interest. Multilateral development banks typically offer loans at rates closer to 2 or 3 percent, and sometimes even closer to zero. One reason China is successful in locking in these higher rates is that better alternatives are often unavailable. Another reason is that Chinese loans, while often requiring the partner to use Chinese contracts, are not as stringent in their requirements for safeguards and reforms.

The port is still not profitable and wont be profitable in the near future which is called white elephant.

i3x8gaj,t1_i3x4ci1,1,8,1649437126.0,lordparata,"I know how GDP is calculated. The loans from China aren’t 10% of GDP. They’re 10% of total external debt. It comes around to $3.5B while Sri Lanka’s GDP is around $80B. And yes I know the GDP will shrink.  Jobs have already been lost and inflation is already rising. That’s literally the problem. It’s why people are on the streets.

The reference to Japan isn’t about Japan taking loans lmao it’s about us taking 10% of our external debt from Japan.

The problem isn’t the Chinese loans. It’s the ISBs that were sold on the market. These have the highest interest rates and account for around 45% of our external debt. That in addition to the massive current account deficit we’re running due to the fall in tourism and increase in fuel prices coupled with the government scrapping the market-based fuel pricing formula and the drop in agricultural output by 50% primarily due to the government’s policy of using organic fertilizer. 

This is in addition to the VAT tax cut and general corruption and granting of jobs for political patronage (look at how many public servants we have) and mass money printing.
