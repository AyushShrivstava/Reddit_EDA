https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdX0hGgbXasgbklN15B05Ei6Lb6Fr6kuM

Now it's more chill. Staying long in one place, we work remotely, so, we can't be in the road constantly. 

The power cuts and fuel shortage didn't affect us that much. Now we are moving less and using more PickMe and Uber rather than public transportation.

We gotta rely more on the 4G (we got SLT) and do hotspot when power cuts happen. 

I don't see much how the power cuts can affect vacacion tourist or travelers since they are mostly outside exploring. 

If I have to say one inconvenience, it would be when the power cut is at night, moskito time, and it's hot. Working editing video on a laptop with no fan it's not good at all.
Besides that, we are having a great time in Sri Lanka and trying to show that and attract as many tourists as possible. 
The country now is open enough and covid restrictions are close to none, so, time to welcome and attract some foreign people to discover or enjoy again this beautiful country.

I truly hope the government and economy gets solved as soon as possible and people get a better situation. We love Sri Lanka and it's hurting and sad seeing it struggling like this for the past few months!",neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

The problem is not a food shortage *( for some imported food items, it is )* but the inflation that makes it hard for people. 

You won't have trouble finding food here as the problem we locals have is LP gas and the higher price of food items. Most of the food items you guys might consume will still be available as they don't consume LP gas as much as the preparation of our local food items does.

The best advice I can give you is to come here and DO NOT EXCHANGE ALL YOUR MONEY to SL Rupees. *( Kind of feel like I betrayed my country, but I should tell you the truth )* LKR is very unstable right now and you can keep your money with you as Dollars or Euros or Sterling Pounds *( Unless any type of those currencies is not accepted here. As far as I know they are )*. Then you can check the exchange rate at the moment and buy things with those currencies and receive the change in Rupees. It is the wisest thing I know that a foreigner coming here can do.

The reason is, the rupee is going down very fast making records! A few days ago, 1 USD = Rs. 260 and then today, it's Rs. 284. So keep them with you and only spent when you need them. Otherwise, if you exchange all of the money you have to LKR and spend them and then exchange the rest back to your currency, you might have lost 10-15% of your money because of the instability of the LKR.

Before covid restrictions, I bought a loaf of bread for Rs. 60 and now it's Rs. 120. The minimum charge for a bus trip was Rs. 10 and now it's Rs. 20. An egg was Rs. 17 and now it's Rs. 35. So be careful like an investor in the stock market whenever you exchange your money to LKR because the government have emptied their treasury and is now printing out new notes without realizing it just devalues the LKR. *( Under the supervision of the seven brains brother of the warrior* \[ You'll get to know him when you come here. LOL! \] *)*  
*Printing notes in that way made a paper shortage in the country and the government had to announce that they don't have enough papers to print papers for school exams!* \- **Just a meme I read, those two are not related ( Or are they? ) except for the fact that there's a paper shortage and the government is bringing notes worth billions of Rupees each week.**
