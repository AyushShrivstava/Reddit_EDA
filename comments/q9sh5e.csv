hgzghtl,t3_q9sh5e,4,0,1634479014.0,Adniwhack,"What you are pointing out is true. Though, I will be the one at the other side of the coin.

Online games are essentially a business, and unlike the old days when the relationship with the game publisher and consumer ends at the point of sale, now you are constantly engaging with the game developers and publishers when you are playing a game. Nowadays, the product sold by the game developers and publishers are not the game, but the consumer. This has resulted in the introduction of predatory mechanics that are being currently under investigation by several other countries and has been likened to gambling.

Couple this with the current trend of digitalization (which has mostly happened), social pressure and the pandemic has increased the attractiveness of video games (put social media to this category also) as an entertainment medium.

Also, game addiction is a real thing, and I believe this is added to DSM-5 recently (I am not a psychologist/psychiatrist, someone can confirm this point for me.) 

Apart from this, these games can create isolation among people, and degrade social interactions. 

What is my message then? Think about the time you spend on online games needlessly. While it is incredibly wrong to pin all blame on video games, being mindful of your usage will indeed help you in the long run.

As a society, I believe we should place more importance on the happiness of the family. 

The truth is, as a third world country, most of us are not in the situation to think about happiness when there is no food on the table. As such, pressure to succeed is a real thing.

But that's what kids play now. Most games on mobile platforms all hook players up to some micro-transaction scam and try to earn that sweet money off of players who want to just win the game. There's games that make it easier for you to win if you pay more for micro-transactions. This is almost cheating and does not stand up to games that you find on other platforms specially on consoles.

The free-to-play games always try to earn something through micro-transactions and its taking a toll on players. Some are good but when you mix business interest with game play it always demeans the game. So best to play stuff you pay upfront, the cheapo mindset of SL parents and lessened control they hold what the child is doing on the phone will lead something bad even if it is not a suicide attempt. Mental illness will explain your hypothesis to a certain extent, but it doesn't explain this new wave of attempts of very small children who the parents say that were ""addicted"" to their phones for a long time, once they were given a phone for studies. Before the govt goes up guns blazing on all online gaming either the gamers will have to update these people on what ""real"" games are and of the pitfalls playing shit or wait till we loose everything because they'll make it worse for everyone.

The dick I mentioned was hard cause of the weird self righteous stance that people have when hating on what most young people consider to be entertainment/trends.
