Your comment shows that you are both historically and economically illiterate. Colonies exist for the economic benefit of the mother country and are useless unless they help to achieve profit. The mother nation should draw raw materials from its possessions and sell them finished goods, with the balance favoring the European country. The colonies also gave the mother country an outlet for exports, which increased jobs and industrial development at home. But none of this would happen if the colonies traded with countries other than their mother, which is why Britain took legal steps to force its colonists to buy and trade only with England. The British began regulating colonial trade to maximize profits under the mercantilist system in the 1660s. The King forbade direct exportation to rival markets. For example, tobacco from Jamestown had to be shipped to England first, where it could be taxed, before it could be sent on and sold elsewhere. 

The end product would be that capital from it's colonies are transferred to the colonial power, thus making England richer. An example is the plunder of Bengal, which directly contributed to the Industrial Revolution in Britain. The capital amassed from Bengal was used to invest in British industries such as textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution and greatly increase British wealth, while at the same time leading to de-industrialization in Bengal.",neutral,negative,positive,neutral

Wooow, what a brilliant strategy invade a nation, enslave its people, steal its resources, leave, make it so that the only way for this nation to heal from the scars you left behind and stand on its own two legs is to get help from you, give back a fraction of what you stole and then have people of that nation praise you for helping smh.

inqr1sd,t1_inq0a2n,4,1,1662740045.0,ISBagent,"Lanka was far from being ‚Äòstone age‚Äô. Lanka was advanced in Romes time and remained so up until the Portuguese invasion. In 50AD when it was rediscovered by a Roman Tax ship sailed astray, Emperor Claudius was shocked to learn that Lanka during the Anuradhapura Kingdom was not only better urbanized than Rome, but also as advanced in its Hydraulics infrastructure as Rome, Egypt, and Babylonnia. The Sinhalese of that time whom the Romans began trading with were detailed as being a noble peoples of Buddhist Dharma who enjoyed immense wealth and plentiful foods, where the average person enjoyed the delicacy‚Äôs of a King and the King lived as an average person. The Imperial Court did not like the Roman people learning about Anuradhapura State Craft, as it came on the heels of Neros suicide. Lanka during this period was ruled by an elected Monarchy which the people themselves were allowed to reject in the event the King fails to uphold the Dasaviddha Rajadhama- the 10 precepts of Kingship set forth by Buddha. 

Furthermore, Sri Lankan trade was widely sought after. The Somali‚Äôs traded Sri Lankan cinnamon with the rest of the world, keeping their Sri Lanka source a secret so that they could monopolize the trade. Textiles and spice sourced from Tamils in Jaffna were making its way into the Silk Road and selling for considerable coinage. The Sinhalese metallurgy was such that the Abassayid Caliphate traded mainly with Sri Lanka when it came to metal based products. 

The military might of Lanka overall was also an anomaly compared to the rest of the subcontinent. Because the Kingdoms of Lanka built tall rather than wide as they were confined to an Island- unlike our Indian counterparts- many aspects to society were advanced at a much more rapid pace, this included the military. Combat training, tactics, and weaponry were much more refined, advanced, and of higher quality than that of the kingdoms of India. And the constant infighting that occurred during the medieval period between the Sinhalese and Tamils meant that there were no short supply of seasoned and experience fighters. While the purpose and efficiency of of militaries would changed based on Kingdoms and Kings, overall the Sri Lankan‚Äôs were not the ones foreign kingdoms risked invading in ancient times unless confident. 

This hesitation to fuck with Lanka was emphasized during the Kingdom of Polonaruwa, where Parakramabahu the Great pushed out the Cholas, sacked and ruled over Burma, saved and ruled over Pandya, and established colonies in what is now West Bengal India, Gujarat India, and Gwadar Pakistan- combined creating the greatest extent of Lanka‚Äôs historical reach. It would not be inflated to say that the Kingdom of Polonaruwa had the capability and man power to conquest a substantial amount of the Indian subcontinent if the King ignored his Consulars.

The Colonial Christian invasions that started with the Portuguese did catch the Sinhalese and Tamils by surprise, as they were quite effective in the beginning due to experience of conquesting other lands. But Tikiri Bandara who later became Rajasinha I of the Sitiwaka Kingdom was able to counter the Portuguese and decimate the captaincy, killing 1,200 in one battle alone. Overall 6,000 Portuguese across 12 Battalions led by the Cortez types failed in conquesting Lanka, a stunning defeat for the Portuguese and their SMOM handlers.

As for the British, they learned the level of who they were dealing with when they found that the inside of the gun barrels used by Kandyan troops had something British guns did not at the time- spirals in the insides of the barrels to induce spin on the bullet when flying in the air, enhancing accuracy. Modernization is often convoluted with westernization. Much of what made the modernization of humanity possible came from non western countries. The Kingdom of Kandy would endure multiple invasions of the British while simultaneously maintaining a stable economy via trade. The British had to resort to garrisoning its troops and destroy hydraulic infrastructure which in turn destroyed the crops, inducing a famine which decimated both sides. By that time both sides were desperate, yet still persistent. What pivot the war into British favor and changed everything was Sri Vikram Rajasinha turning into a drunkard and adulterer, resulting in him falling out of social and political favor of the people and the Kandyan nobility. The nobility were convinced by the British that they‚Äôd have a place among King Georges court if they flipped sides. The Kandyan nobility as a result sacked Sri Vikram Rajasinha and signed a treaty with the British. The British then sacked the nobility and replaced them with a new Bandara‚Äôs who were not leaders, but followers. The descendants of these followers took charge of the ‚Äòindependent‚Äô government and ran it all into the fucking ground creating the mess we have today. Look at the succession of Presidents and Prime Ministers since Queen Elizabeth and you will see a Pattern where less than 10 families all linked to each other have held the power. 

Also, in regards to modernization/Westernization, yes the British did provide Lanka with rail line infrastructure, and reconfigured the provincial lines and statecraft to enhance certain aspects of government. But they did not repair the hydraulic infrastructure that 2,500 years worth of Kings built as they saw no use in it, they destroyed the agricultural diversity and by extension the highland environment in order to ramp up tea production which has became the main commodity Lanka is dependent on to function, they stole all of our Gold/Gems/Artifacts, they branded our Pre-History as ‚Äòmyth‚Äô, and they attempted to erode and replace  the Hindu/Vedic culture and Sanatan/Buddha Dharma that made us who we are with their Christian Ity (Masonic State)- branding any who didn‚Äôt accept their God and their way as ‚ÄúDharmic Savages‚Äù. This all led to the Uva Rebellion and later on support for the Reich and Imperial Japan, which resulted in the British to take a far step back and have a more lassie fair approach over its governance of Lanka. But don‚Äôt think that their fuckery stopped after ‚Äòindependence‚Äô. The British ‚Äòmodernization‚Äô and westernization of Lanka came at the expense of everyone and everything else and continues as we speak.",neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

That is the exact fricking definition of a period of a national mourning, if I have a flag at my building I'm forced to lower it whether I like it or not, the entire nation has to mourn whether they like it or not. No ones putting a gun to your head hand demand that you mourn but symbolically that is what a period of national mourning is.

Education was still only kept for the elite and was done mostly in English, the average Sinhala or Tamil person who didn't know English were effectively kept out of the education system and out of government positions too. And schools were basically indoctrination camps rather than schools, that's why they were interested in education if they had any interest in educating our people in the first place. Dependency on English, superiority of the British crown, colonial mentaily and the loyalty to the British crown were smoothly put into children's mind at a young  age.  A recent post on this sub showed a poem from colonial days that school children had to learn, which has basically teaching how children should be good loyal subjects of the Crown and how amazing and great the King was.

Hate to break it to you but we are stupid. Our ppl are world class fools. 

In 2019, a majority of ppl voted for Gota. His platform had a few key points

1. Anti Western (Anti IMF) - Pro China Foreign Policy
2. Keeping Interest Rates Low 
3. Reducing Taxes 
4. Homegrown solutions and protectionist foreign/trade policy 

All of which was the reason he won the election. Anyone with a brain knew that this was a recipe for disaster. Yet a overwhelming majority voted for him because of those key points. 

Now ppl are surprised and asking why we didn't raise taxes, why did we keep rates low, why didn't we go to the IMF. Well because our moronic voters didn't want it  and now they are blaming gota for the very reason they voted to begin with.

Also from my initial comment; 
> The mother nation should draw raw materials from its possessions and sell them finished goods, with the balance favoring the European country. The colonies also gave the mother country an outlet for exports, which increased jobs and industrial development at home.

They could use them to build industries at home, but that would require more capital which they didn't have. So they became resource economies entirely depending on exporting raw materials.

What I meant by the last point is that the globalized system which is new meant that industrialized countries don't need to waste money on maintaining colonies when the globalized markets did transfer capital away from the former colonies. Why spend a lot of money on troops and infrastructure to keep them, when markets can do that to you? A good proof for this is that countries that colonial powers that couldn't form neocolonial structures often held tightly to their colonies, such as Portugal for example as [explained by a historian here](https://research.unl.pt/ws/portalfiles/portal/3628524/PedroAiresOliveiraDecolonizationPortugueseAfrica.pdf):

How does that change anything, she is a direct beneficiary of her families colonisation and when she was asked to repeatedly to disavow atrocities committed by the throne she refused.

>but no evidence, no logic

I have made one point. The point I made is backed up by literal, direct quotes from the comment chain. I've told you to try respond to it like 3 times. Nothing was out of thin air I don't know how you're struggling to actually understand what's being said to you. I get you want to pop off and sound clever with some big comment but just read the thread slowly and actually say something that isn't just masturbatory nonsense lmao.

Look at this man child wiggling and sweating, trying to appear legitimate.

Saying the same thing over and over again doesn't make it more right. you said the conversation is about modernisation, then you proceeded to claim my statement is about modernisation, and claimed original post was about escaping feudalism. Of none of which you can corroborate, nor articulate as to how so, in anyway what so ever. None of your claims and remarks had any basis. If it were it wouldn't have been this hard for you to copy the exact quotes from above and articulate your point. Saying ""exactly that, exactly that"" doesn't cover it. At least not in the adult world.

Go outside your cave and touch some grass you tiny little baby troll. I don't care at this point, I'm done with your hissy fit. Whatever you have to say have zero contribution to any conversation what so ever. I'm sure every person you met in your real life must have hinted at that by now, if not directly said to your face.
