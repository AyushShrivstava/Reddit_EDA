It will be a very small part of the book I am writing about Medieval Sri Lanka, the fall of the Cholan Empire and the rise of the Kingdom of Kandy.

I just try to look at things observationally and I try not to take the past personally.

I think Sri Lanka would have done fine without British Influence. But they would likely be in a disadvantaged position in a few areas for much longer.

The question really is simple.

Did the British leave Sri Lanka with more universities, a more literate population, a bigger middle class, involved them more heavily in world trade, provide exposure to modern technology such as electricity, scientific knowledge and infrastructure. The answer is YES.

Self sufficiency is fine. But all modern economies need to combine both.

Cash crops and mass production bring in more money.

They will always be prioritised by any developing or developed country than a small trade and barter economy.

And when the new government took over in 1948, they inherited those structures. That is a GOOD inheritance and gave Sri Lanka the same advantage that Singapore had in the 20th century. A country more modern than most of its neighbours and peers.

I'm really happy you know about the Muslim/Catholic Refugees of the 18th century. Sri Lanka was almost always at least 2 or 3 separate kingdoms at any one time. There was on and off war between the Tamil Arya Chakravarti of Jaffna and Singhalese Kings of Kotte. But there was also on and off trade and peace. There was likewise a lot of conflict between the Kingdom of Kotte and Kandy, both Singhalese anyway. Point is the country always struggled with unity. Most countries do. This is normal. Just look at  medieval Scotland and England etc or Egypt and Sudan. Very normal.

But regarding the divide and rule strategy, it was not a legal policy. Just a practice. of employing the most educated. The Jaffna Tamils had better universities. OFC It lead to public resentment. 50% of educated jobs were held by Tamils who were about 20-30%% of the population. That's not fair, but at that point, it was still peaceful and fixable.

The Singhalese Colombo elites were still the wealthiest and most educated. By 1948 the education gap could have been FIXED then and there with time, effort, patience, forgiveness and planning.  Reconciliation is always the first act of nation building.

The British allowed free elections in 1948. The Singhalese majority still formed the majority government and held the power to make the changes necessary to improve the lives of both Tamils and Singhalese. There was a chance there to make things BETTER. But Bandaranaike decided to allow the mobs of protestors to kill hundred to thousands of innocent Tamils in the streets for DECADES to grow his own power. Divide and rule was unjust, but it could have been fixed.

But Discriminate and Kill is always worse, and totally unacceptable.",neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

But anyway.

Not sure if you realise.
That ALL those problems you mentioned pre dated the British period.
They may have worsened under British influence, but they were all ready violent and there was a history of bloodshed before and long after the British were there.

European Jews were coming in large numbers by 1882/3 during the Ottoman period. 
More than 40 years prior to the British rule of Palestine.

They were not well received at all by the locals at any time.
Ethnic divide between Jews and Arabs created to parralel societies.

In fact there were so many riots, massacres and attacks on Jewish settlements by Palestinians Arabs in the 1910s the Jews formed a paramilitary defence force called the Harshomer for the sole purpose of stopping Arab insurgents from killing them.

Things got worse in the 1930s and 1940s in the  Holocaust because millions of Jews left Europe for Palestine, leading to a full scale war once the British army  left in 1947/48.

The India and Pakistan conflict predates anything the before and existed long after the British.


https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_massacres_in_India
Have a look at the list of massacres in the  1600s-1700s, 50 to 100 years before the British established themselves firmly in India.
And you will read all about how the Mughals, Sikhs, Marathas and Northern Tribals/ ""Afghans"" from modern Pakistan massacred each other in the 1000s to 400 000+  numbers killed. It was not peaceful when the British arrived. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_massacres_in_India

The British rule in India was cruel and unjust.
Borderline evil in many cases.
But don't forget the British only controlled 60% of the Indian population, the other 40% was run by the locals Rajas.
These local Rajas were just as violent as the British in suppressing their enemies.

By the 1920s to 1940s, the Muslim league and various Hindu communities gained power and perpetrated their own violence before and after independence.

What the British and also the local princely Rajas in Rajastan are guilty of is trying to stop and delay the democratic independence movement by any means possible.
They targeted both Hindus and Muslims meetings of different states and ethnicities.
They didn't care how many they killed on either side.
There was no favouritism.

https://www.indiastudychannel.com/resources/174489-A-painful-chapter-of-Indian-history-The-Mangarh-massacre-1913.aspx

This lead to massacres like Mangarh Rajastan Massacre (1913) where indian troops from the British army and troops from the local Rajas army opened fire on democratic meetings killing 1500 people at a political rally.
The British did the same thing alone at Amritsar (1919) and in Gujarat (1922) with similar numbers.

Meanwhile in other parts of India, there was massacres of 10,000 Hindus and Muslims in Kerela (1921).
Nothing to do with the British, it started as a dispute between peasants and landlords.
Then religious groups got involved and it became Muslim vs Hindu problem. Ethnic and religious violence also took place in Calcutta (1946) where political Muslim and Hindu parties encouraged genocide of each other on ethnic grounds.
These events happened co currently to the British and Rajas suppressing Independence protests by shooting them.

Once the British army left in 1947, the Muslim league and the new majority Hindu government took the guns and the massacres didn't stop for 10 years.
They say a few million died.

In short, many of these countries were experiencing violence and division before, during and after the British rule.

British rule in  Sri Lanka didn't have the problems or massacres that British rule in India had.
It was mostly peaceful up until Bandaranike in the 1950s.

1. I think India has a history of near constant famines.
Millions dying.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine_in_India

Under Maratha and Mughal rule, even hundreds of years before millions died regularly.
This indicated the problem was really endemic to the geography.

The Famine in Bengal 1943 was a result of crop failure, cyclone and definitely corruption from the British admin, but it's was not a genocide. 
Academic studies are very clear on that.

The same thing happened in Ireland 1845.
Yes, the British mismanaged both.
But there was enough pre existing conditions for a disaster. Not to mention the British ended the Famine in 1944 anyway.

2. I think most of what Tucker said was actually true, but alot of what Prasanth said was also true.
Nobody can agree that the British did not build the infrastructure, the schools, the transportation, and provided the ground works for a great legal system. Alot of that was used to bring wealth to the upper class, the ruling rajas and ofc the British admin.

3. The India Pakistan conflict is really the fault and responsibility of the Indians and the Pakistanis themselves. 
The bloke who drew the map Cyril Radcliffe was asked by Indian and Pakistani leaders to do.
The British were seen as a third party.

In short, they were fighting when the British got there and they were fighting when thr British left.

Before that there was constantly wars and periods of peace followed by more wars.
