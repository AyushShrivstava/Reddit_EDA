I can't honestly believe people compare the rajapakshas and anyone else lol.

The rajapakshas have their own rank with no equal. Its ridiculous how much they've ruined and continue to ruin the country. 

The literal personification of greed. Even when we got a 1bn loan for essential they imported ""essential infrastructure material"" for 500mn and only 300mn was kept for essential imports.

The level of greed is worse than any other govt that ever came to power. 

The only comparison I can think of would be the British when we were colonised and they looted our country for all our natural resources.
