hzb49w7,t1_hzb0k2z,27,1,1646396741.0,manulapamuditha,"saw your post asking about him cause you are an immigrant child of Sri Lankan parents. I'm running a bit late today, so I'll explain in brief and some others might add the things I might forget  


**- Dirty politics here!**  
He appoints the people he wants to the positions which play a critical role in law enforcement. He made the court (Supreme, maybe. Don't wanna get arrested like Ranjan) release many people after making them relieved of all the accusations including criminals and the people responsible for the Easter Sunday attack.  


**- Shitty ruling**  
!He came to the election like a superhero and have no experience in politics. When some students in a school told him ""Our computers are broken, we separated parts and checked 2 out of 5"" his answer was ""Didn't you check the other 3?""

&#x200B;

**- Excessive expenses for media attention**  
He goes from village to village to know about the problems faced by rural people. It was something he planned to do for a while, but I can't remember it very much. He goes there and speaks with people about their problems. Just because he comes, stages and other facilities are arranged for him, which can be used for the betterment of the villages.

  
**- Autocratic behaviour**  
Once he was out in an above kind of a programme where he was told about an issue about not getting something provided to people by the government by a village woman. Then the president asked an officer responsible for that sector and he said all of it was provided and no more stocks. (Or something like that, anyway, the point was she was not given because of not allocating enough) Then the president told him to give it and the officer told him that he needs a circular to do it. Then the president said **Whatever I say is a circular.**

\[I can remember a comment by my History teacher about that incident. He said the people were stupid to clap when he said that (People clapped when the president said that) He said ""What if a secretory comes to the president when he's raging with anger and ask him for a sign?"" The president might lose it and say ""Stuff it in your a$$"" and then the teacher said ""Whatever he says is a circular and that man must literally do it!""\]

&#x200B;

**- Releasing Dumind Silva**  
Hiru TV owner's brother Duminda silva was released from prison with special presidential powers. He was sentenced to death because of a murder. It was done in public and yet released him cause his brother's TV channel helped Gota during his presidential campaign a lot.(And yet, they kept Ranjan Ramanayaka in prison for speaking out the truth)

  
**- Destroying economy**  
When he came to power, 1 USD was worth 170-180 SLR, but now it's about 200$. They wasted dollars we had on useless projects from which they can take a commission and gave those dollars to their business friends at a lower rate through government banks. And they pointed out so many rupee notes making the value of the SLR go down making the inflation increase by 15% as of today. And then started distributing that newly printed money to people during covid to cover up their failure.

&#x200B;

**- Treating best friends with special privileges.**  
 A tax of Rs.50.00 per kg is charged from the imported sugar. When his friends imported sugar one time, he lowered the tax to Rs.00.25 *(25 cents or the previous tax divided by 200 or 0.5% of the previous tax )* And then his friends were able to sell sugar at the same old rate giving them an extra profit of Rs.49.75 per every kilogramme of sugar.

**- 20th amendments of the constitution**  
They got 2/3 power in the parliament and made changes to the parliament giving the president more powers and making the law enforcement sector politically vulnerable.some interesting facts  
= Presidents transactions and expenses can not be investigated anymore  
= President could appoint supreme court judges before, but couldn't remove them. With the new amendment, he can appoint and fire them both. *(It's the god mode baby!)*

**- Taking a big sum of dollars from Sri Lanka to Nigeria (Unconfirmed)**  
This is unconfirmed as they had no comments. Recently Mahinda R went to Thirupadi kovil to take blessings as he is one of the best and well-known Buddhists in Sri Lanka. He used a private jet provided by a businessman friend to go there. They say that [about 102 tons of printed paper was taken to Uganda](https://www.sundaytimes.lk/210418/news/sla-uplifts-102-tons-of-printed-material-to-uganda-but-refuses-to-give-details-440509.html) in that plane. They say it was just printed paper. I'm sure he wasn't going to start a press in Uganda with those papers. I'm sure they are not going to steal all the dollars from poor people like us.

These are some of the reasons why we hate him, not to mention the electricity, fuel problems.  
Had some more things to mention, but I'm really running late now.
