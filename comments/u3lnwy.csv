US Civil war wasn't primarily fought to free slaves. It was one of the objectives, and gave moral backing, especially to keep Europe out of the war.

In any such movement, there is always a violent group and a non violent group. Blacks had armed movements, Indians too. But those didn't lead the way. LTTE killed all non violent groups and led the movement. We know how that went (I'm Tamil).

Mirihana was made violent by their own people. You can interpret things either way.

Looting that happened during George Floyd protests are overblown to be honest. US right wing wants to highlight looting and riots to take the focus away from the real protests. BLM was a great concept in the beginning. However, the leaders of BLM were corrupt. That was really the downfall. They stole so much of the money that was donated and I think one is even in trouble with the law currently because she purchased like 3 mansions from the donated money. 

BLM protests were completely different too, though. They too thought having a hashtag would get their message home. It did to the extent that all the corporations started using #BLM in their tv ads for rest of the year. It didn't bring any real change because they were too focused on being black and alienating other poor working class demographics. I'm not denying that African Americans and latinos face more challenges than other races but if they had concentrated less on identity politics but more on class politics, I think the results would have been a little different. 

Look up Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. It was an area in Seattle that was occupied by BLM protestors like what's currently happening in Galle Face. Needless to say, it didn't do anything. People just went home after a while.
