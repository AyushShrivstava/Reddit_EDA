A bookish teenager with a passion for Demonology. She helps her friends to track down and solve paranormal activities using her expertise as an investigator.

Instagram model, Ticktocker, and Velma's BFF. Her attempts to gather followers with weird videos derail at the worst of times.

Hemal Ranasinghe as Fred Jones
