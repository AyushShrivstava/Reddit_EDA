Let's be honest we can blame our politicians for their greed, but at the end of the day, it's the ppl that vote for a bottle of liquor or pay a commission to get a tender.

Lots of ppl seem to be anti taxes because of ""corruption"". The funny thing is that even if we didn't have corruption, ppl would still be against taxes at the end of the day they are as greedy as the politicians. 

No politicians would ever be elected if they said they were raising taxes. Gota got the Colombo crowds votes because he cut their taxes. 

The ppl of this country are no different than the politicians we elect to represent us.

Would you vote for someone that promised to raise your taxes and give it to the lowest income 20% of households ? Be honest 90% of you would be against it. Hell, even I wouldn't be thrilled about it.

Even though we have declared all our assets and payed our due without any delay at all, they STILL try to find SOMETHING they could use to get more money. And basically, going to answer their questions is about the same as an interrogation.

Additionally, the tax process of our country is very complicated and hard for a laymen to understand, which isn’t the case with other so-called “developed” countries.

Plus, my parents also get taxes cut off their salaries in ADDITION to the income tax. The amount cut isn’t small.

This is why many government professionals are against increasing taxes.

Not to mention the fact that the government has implemented a lot of circular taxes, which is why many of the things in your neighborhood supermarket have become eye-wateringly expensive.

But yeah, the truth is most of the people in this country didn’t and don’t pay taxes. The government always took taxes from their employees, but not from rest of the general population. Whenever they needed some more cash, they always took from the people working for them. Many private businessmen would earn much, much more, and they wouldn’t give a cent to the government, nor would the government ask them too.

And yes, the government never did anything in return for the money they took. Nor will they. The government today is the same as the government yesterday. Increasing taxes is good and yeah our people don’t like to pay shit, but can you trust the people at the top with your money? Plus, it was they who decided to install the broken tax system in the first place. They are responsible. So are we for installing them.

Let's see the real context:

* The entire debate from the pro-Ranil side (because that's what it really is) completely ignores that **many people are fine with tax just not to the Rajapaksa govt** (yes Ranil is a part of that). Bhanuka completely avoids the possibility that his team member simply doesn't want to pay tax to a Rajapaksa govt. This tax debate is an attempt to legitimize Ranil's govt and its going to backfire on us really hard.
* We have already seen them not use our tax money wisely, they ruined the country but even now they raised the defence budget while decreasing the health + food security budget. Addressing corruption absolutely must come first before taxes but these people are trying to convince you that we can skip solving corruption which is actually how we got to this mess in the first place. So this whole ""you can hold them accountable with tax"" argument is complete bullshit
* Assuming we do pay tax to this current govt, then what? We know they're very likely to continue corruption and wasting it and when that does happen then what? Do we hold people like OP accountable? When they use the higher tax to further increase the military budget how will we even protest?
* u/TriAlpha is someone who is consistently pushing whatever Ranil's agenda is at the time, right now that's pitting actual working professionals against each other to shift blame from the govt, and its working, we still have no actual attempt to fix corruption despite it easily being one of the biggest issues
* Using income brackets is an attempt to paint the debate black & white when really the very idea of ""middle-class"" is a grey area in SL. Just because the govt has managed to keep 80% of Sri Lanka poor doesn't mean that earning $500 is ultra-rich. It doesn't make you ultra-poor either but to frame the top 10% as anyone earning 100k+ here and then acting like they are the owners of corporations and part of the 1% elite is disingenuous
* You can be pro-tax but not for this government, the tax debate isn't some armchair black and white thing, you absolutely must take context. I'm pro-tax but no one has been able to justify why the fuck anyone should pay tax to a Rajapaksa govt
* Corporate tax is still cut, if you want to get immediate tax right now look to corporate tax because they owe it to us after their cuts ruined the country, while the middle-class was the only thing keeping this place developed.
* Bhanuka himself earns a ton of money and if income bracket tax suffices he'd proportionally be favored because the taxes disproportionally affect middle-income brackets. If he earns 2 mil while someone earns 1 mil, his tax is far easier to manage. Bhanuka is no shining beacon of philanthropy lmao, he is very much part of the same techbro startup culture that is absolutely failing to keep our programmers here.

This is the problem, this is a narrative that is only vaguely true and misses a huge amount of context, you probably saw those tax:GDP charts right? Well the same people pushing those charts don't show you our GDP:Military:Education:Health ratios either.

Which comes to your second point (why we can't do both), we can't do both because reforming the govt and dealing with corruption comes first and we're not even dealing with corruption so we're not doing both to begin with. No country is perfectly free from corruption but there is clearly a certain level where no matter what you do its next to impossible to develop the country with rampant corruption, higher taxes not only doesn't deal with that issue but it give even less incentive for them to be accountable. How does giving Mahinda free money make him accountable? The proof of this argument is that despite so much push-back on taxes the govt STILL increased the military budget and decreased the health + food security budget, we saw right away that the ""tax will make them accountable"" argument was not true.

I'd suggest reading up on Botswana, a country which had a mildly similar situation which managed to transform to one of the fastest developing African countries in the world, they consistently mention dealing with corruption as one of the main reasons for this.

Most of your posts on purposely frame specific narratives to push whatever agenda you're thinking of at the time, its genuinely sad and pathetic, I debate for reason and to fight the good fight, you're clearly doing it because you're some bored nobody who seems to have failed abroad and has to rip on other actual professionals.

Lol, I wish this was true. Now, if I was insecure, I would prove it, but I have better things to do that. But if believing I don't pay taxes is true helps u cope, please continue to do so 

>It's funny how all you care about is internet points, even on Twitter you left because of how dumb you sound constantly, you finally got one thread where people agree, and you love it lol.

Again, with the jumping to conclusions. Whatever helps you cope. I will admit to only loving the fact that it's pissing you off. 

FYI I'm less active on Twitter because there's way too much happening on there. I end up spending too much time on Twitter neglecting my commitments, whereas on reddit, the Sub barely has 3 posts worth commeting on a day vs the dozens of tweets. Reddit let's me be active in discourse without that much of a time commitment since I'm never able to walk away from an argument.

If raising taxes reduces or stops the printing of money, that's all I care about. Less money printed = less inflation.

Inflation is the main issue we are facing, it's what's having the worst impact on Lankans from a big picture point of view. From the working professional who makes 200k to the three wheel driver who makes 20k",negative,negative,negative,negative

To me, effect use of the taxes means the government uses the money to fund the government expenditures without having to print money to cover the short fall. It's pretty simple  

The government doesn't make enough cash, so it prints money to cover deficit. If new taxes move, the needle will reduce the inflationary pressure of money printing. That's the effect use of taxes. 

Now you can disagree that's up to you, but to me, that's a great step towards recovery, lol.

Stop deflecting the question and actually answer it. Why would THIS govt be accountable with our tax money? I + many others, again, are NOT AGAINST TAX we are against a CORRUPT GOVT using it. Inflation is still happening and predicted to stay in the double digits for the rest of this year while the Rajapaksa's stolen assets alone are said to equal the IMF bailout, why should working professionals be burdened with the money already stolen from our govt?

Maybe an easier way to explain this is, if a Mahinda supporter told me during Mahinda's time that Mahinda needs higher taxes and he'll put it to good use, you'd be skeptical right? This time is not only similar but even worse because the ones paying the tax aren't the ones who got us here, most of them didn't even vote Rajapaksa and now they are paying for their crimes while they STILL are in parliament",neutral,positive,positive,positive

You're living in a dream world where everything is based on right and wrong, good and bad.

In a dream world, MR would have been arrested for corruption in 2015, and Gota would have been arrested for war crimes in 2010. Instead, our ppl gave them an overwhelming mandate in the last election.

My point is Rajapakses corruption was soo fucking obvious we all knew it for years, in reality 90% of the funds they stole were between 2005 -2015, thsi time there wasnt much for them to work with. but still ppl voted for them because they promised then less taxes and more friendly regulation in 2019 

The ppl didn't care if the Rajapakses stole as long as they got something out of it as well.  How else do you explain why they got soo many fucking votes ?


>Stop deflecting the question and actually answer it. Why would THIS govt be accountable with our tax money? I + many others, again, are NOT AGAINST TAX we are against a CORRUPT GOVT using it.


Look, every government in LK has been corrupt, and any future one will also be corrupt. In a ideal world we raise taxes and cut down spending drastically.

We should cut down our bloated public sector, sell off loss making SOEs, and get rid of half the army but these things will never happen no matter how much I want them to.

For one these things can't happen overnight. For example, it takes at least 5 years to cut the army in half on a realistic time scale. But not a single political party in the entire country is for cutting defense or cutting the public sector for a very simple reason. 

Because they would lose votes. I can keep dreaming about these things happening but in reality it's highly unlikely to ever happen. No matter who is in power. SJB,UNP,SLPP,SLFP,JVP,TNA, it doesn't matter. None of them will do what's necessary. Hence, they will all be corrupt and working for their own interests.

That's why I'm settling for less inflation because I know no matter who's elected, the story may be different but not the tune. 

So let me put the question to you, how do you know that another won't be as corrupt or even more than this one ?

Corruption is in Sri Lankan Nature unfortunately,

Disagree, lots of ""working professionals"" voted last time. While knowing full well about the Rajapakses corruption. Just look at the polling data",negative,negative,negative,negative
