Local curriculum should teach children modern history, of both SL as well as the world. They will then see parallels between the leaders of their nation, and historic fuck ups of past leaders. A lot of adults over 35 do not know the specifics of who Hitler is or much about the world war, because they weren't taught that, so it's obvious people in 2019 were keen to have a leader like Hitler, because they don't know who he is.

They should teach shit like the 83 pogroms, SL civil war, post independence SL... etc.

This entire thing I talked about is one aspect only, another one I'd add is our culture as a whole (not talking about 2500) where we Just only think of today's issues. We wouldn't be in this mess if that wasn't the case either, because GR cut a shit ton of taxes we lost money, and now the IMF is basically bringing back that tax system but instead of just to the basic salary it's to the whole income.

An example,


Uniforms of female schoolteachers and students should not change: Palitha Thero (2022)


Responding to the request made by the Ceylon Teachers' Union (CTU) Secretary Joseph Stalin to grant the opportunity to wear suitable, comfortable clothes for female teachers to attend schools, the Nalandaramaya Chief Incumbent Chief Secretary Ven. Palitha Thera said the circular issued in this regard by the Public Administration Ministry on September 27 does not apply to teachers at all.

Addressing the media, he said the CTU Secretary had requested the Education Secretary to allow female teachers the opportunity to follow a more lenient dress code to attend schools.

The prelate mentioned that Sri Lanka is a country with a 2,600-year-old Buddhist culture and identity.

""Buddhist monks, military personnel, police, school teachers and students have unique uniforms. As required by the CTU Secretary and non-government organizations (NGOs), they cannot change the uniforms of teachers or students in the country. ""If that happens, there is bound to be a great disaster,"" he said.

""Even in the Old Testament of the Bible, it is clearly said that women's clothes should be used for women and men's clothes for men without changing, and it is an insult to God. Therefore ignoring this custom could be very disastrous to this country and its culture,"" he said.

Hence, I do not believe Education Minister Susil Premajayantha would allow the change of the uniforms of the teachers and students as per the wishes of external sources, Ven. Palitha said.

He added that the minister would not take any actions to ruin the culture and identity of the country.
