I will be posting an image of each country's trains in their national sub-reddits, one each day in alphabetical order, starting on 20/08/20, because I am a sad train nerd with nothing better to do.

Note - countries with no active railways will not be included.",neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

h1po5m3,t1_ggsid5k,1,2,1623662116.0,TheSpiritOfZanzibar,Agreed definitely not slower specially during the office hours. But it's jam packed to the teeth. I travelled once from Colombo 3 to Mount Lavinia during office hours. The train took around 15 mins I guess whereas it'd take me almost an hour by bus. But it was so packed that the sole  of my shoe came off while I was getting out the train ðŸ˜‚,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral
