Either blaming politicians in general, trying to settle a score with a party/politician they don't like or just a sweeping comment to suggest all this happens because of politicians. 

Truth is that we live in a system of representative democracy. Which means our politicians are just a bunch who we selected to represent us. If they are not good enough, then that simply means that we ourselves are not good enough. 

Better to focus on self improvement. Blaming others is a part of the problem, not the solution.",negative,neutral,neutral,neutral
