The more practical thing would be;

1. To ask them to remove that fucking stupid peak and off peak categorisation. It's absolutely stupid and people have to stay up late to use the data they paid for.
2. Give a relatively higher data caps. I would settle for doubling my the data given from current [Family](https://slt.lk/en/personal/broadband/ftth/packages?item_id=1013) and [Super](https://slt.lk/en/personal/broadband/ftth/packages?item_id=1014) categories of packages for now.

First of all, providing unlimited data isn't simple as you may think. There are infrastructure limitations. Simply put, there is a limit to the bandwidth our current networks can handle. If everyone get unlimited, entire networks will go down.

Now if we turn to the much more practical solution, which is removing peak / off peak limits, we still end up with the same problem. ISPs have already released a statement regarding this. ""Off peak"" data or ""Night time data"" are offered as a bait in order to sell more internet packages. So basically you are paying for your peak data. Offpeak data is given to you for free. This is a marketing trick because average consumers dont use internet during off peak hours. If they remove this limit additional bandwidth could potentially cause issues to our existing networks.

It's important to understand even if they introduce an unlimited package it will be very expensive and average consumers won't be able to pay for that.

Finally, if we need better internet, we simply have to improve our current infrastructure. Currently, Sri Lanka in a unstable situation.  It's up to our leaders and the government to improve these things. Unless our country become politically stable, attract more investors and pay off our debt, I dont see this happening.

* There are smaller providers that have been around long enough in developed countries that offer fast unlimited (or essentially unlimited) internet at very affordable prices.
* If you shop online at the ISP's website for internet packages, it might look expensive but this might be for several reasons, such as the internet provider might want customers to bundle internet, cable, cellphone etc in one package, or the apartment a person lives in has an agreement with a provider that has been negotiated by the condo association (so the tenant doesn't have a choice). These giant conglomerates still market to the older boomer generation so they try to push cable tv etc. as well.
* The prices seen online aren't always the actual prices a customer can get and better deals are offered. If you walk in to a store or pick up the phone and call, you're usually going to get a better offer. TV ads also show better deals than those online.
* Most middle-class people in developed countries can afford internet packages for unlimited data relative to their income.
