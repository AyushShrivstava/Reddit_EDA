Muruththettuwe Ananda Thero to the position of the Chancellor of the University of Colombo showed their displeasure of it in the Ceremonial Graduation 2019 of the University of Colombo.

Many students participated in the graduation wearing black arm bands while some even refused to accept the certificate from Muruththettuwe Ananda Thero.

The Faculty of Management and Finance Teachers‚Äô Association (FMFTA) also boycotted the event.

Issuing a statement, the trade union said the decision has been taken to show its displeasure on the appointment of Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thero to the position of the Chancellor of the University of Colombo.

On 6 November, the President addressed the media, where he spoke of the appointment.
‚ÄúI gave the chancellor position to Ananda Thera. The monk helped this Government to come to power. He made contributions from the time of President Mahinda Rajapaksa. However, due to some reasons, the monk spoke against us recently. Parliamentarian and President‚Äôs Counsel Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, and MP Ranil Wickremesinghe visited the Thera and sought advice. People like Ceylon Teachers‚Äô Union General Secretary Joseph Stalin and Ceylon Teachers‚Äô Service Union General Secretary Mahinda Jayasinghe also went to seek advice. They all went to the Thera seeking advice but when the Thera becomes the Chancellor, they say that it is not appropriate,‚Äù said the President.
