This is the source, We are amongst the highest GST paying countries and this is a problem, it disproportionately affect poor families (say they have 5 ppl in household and they pay more GST than 3 ppl rich family).. very inefficient (compared to income tax) and we dont tax actual rich and wealthy people.

example 
> 
> For example, imagine two individuals each purchase $100 of clothing per week, and they each pay $7 in tax on their retail purchases. The first individual earns $2,000 per week, making the sales tax rate on her purchase 0.35 percent of income. In contrast, the other individual earns $320 per week, making her clothing sales tax 2.2 percent of income. In this case, although the tax is the same rate in both cases, the person with the lower income pays a higher percentage of income, making the tax regressive.",neutral,negative,negative,negative

This is from the wiki 
> Indirect taxes in the forms of excise duties, VAT and tariffs are the key contributors to the government tax revenue with 74% while direct taxes including income tax, Pay-as-you-earn tax and Economic Service Charge contribute only around 9%
> Sri Lankan tax system is regarded as one of the most complicated tax structures in the world.
