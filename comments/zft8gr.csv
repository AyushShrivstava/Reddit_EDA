Given our electricity generation cost, now it ~~is feasible~~  is not feasible. But we need to upgrade our railways system.

British did't make the system for public transportation. It is for transportation of goods. Current railway-system is a nightmare to passengers.

Also, in near future we need electric trains, because fossil fuel will not last forever.
