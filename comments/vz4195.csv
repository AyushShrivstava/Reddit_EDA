To do this, more hydraulics must first need to be restored in order to optimize the water distribution for agricultural and industrial energy consumption that will come should do the following to jumpstart ourselves in the short term:

- Straighten out the agricultural industry and diversify the produce for later expansion while also ensuring our domestic market is served as the primary customer before the international market.
- Regulate the textiles industry to ensure our services are no longer being undercut, and expand the production. A higher quality Agricultural industry will allow higher quality textiles to be produced, thus catering to a different tier of buyer. Textiles is also entirely how Bangladesh jump started its economy.
- Overhaul the education system to be STEM which will become the workhorse of the economy later on. 

For context to STEM, 2 examples:

IT is big in India which accounts for 8% of its GDP (2020), where they produce $45 Billion domestically and $150 Billion in exports from oversees work using a little over half of their 4.5 million tech workers. Compare that to the 2 million Sri Lankan workers mostly working in the servant industry in the Middle East producing $7 Billion in personal remittances (2019) which has dwindled to $1.3 Billion at the beginning of this year.

Another example is Medical, which is big in Philippines and accounts for 8% of Filipino GDP. According to a 2017 report, the combined domestic and oversees work of the medical industry accounted for $31 Billion in GDP for the Philippines.

And for overall GDP context: Florida, a US State, has basically the same total population (Florida 21.2 million, Lanka 21.9 million), and same employed population (Florida 8.49 million, Lanka 8 million), yet produces $1.2 Trillion in GDP per year while we produce $80 Billion in GDP per year... India’s tech industry alone produces nearly twice the amount our entire country produces. If Florida was a sovereign state, it would be ahead of Indonesia in GDP. Florida’s agricultural industry accounts for a small portion of that GDP, which is heavy on finance, professional services, enterprise, education and health, and trade (retail, wholesale, manufacturing). It’s natural resource output is less than its agricultural output which accounts for $6.3 Billion of its GDP, meaning if we get STEM right on the long term, we will have no need to even touch our natural resources or even agricultural industry to produce a strong and powerful economy.

Oh and if you’re a train geek, Floridas Brightline Rail project is linking Miami to Jacksonville which is the same distance as Galle to Jaffna. Miami to West Palm beach is the same distance as Galle to Colombo, and West Palm Beach to Orlando is roughly the same distance as Colombo to Kandy.
