idte2fm,t3_vl42ig,83,0,1656257703.0,TheRomanRenegade,"First and foremost, we are indeed grateful to the Indian Government for all the chunky lines of credit it has given Sri Lanka at present.

But let's not kid ourselves. There are ulterior motives at play here. Namely, the elephant in the room; China. If India didn't step up, China would've been free to go on a shopping spree buying up strategic points from which they could gain a formidable foothold in the Indian Ocean. And again, we are grateful to India irrespective of its motives because in the end, it was a win-win for both India in the long-term and Sri Lanka in the short-term. If you really do need a pat on the back for all this, consider this it.

Now onto the Aussies...they came for a tour at a time when we are at our lowest. We barely had the ability to keep the lights on. The Aussie Team coming here managed to garner us a spotlight in communicating our plight to the world. The players actively boosted our tourism industry which would help us in the long-term to increase our pathetic forex reserves. In the end, we thanked them for their contribution in a way that we could. Not to mention, this was a huge PR boost in and of itself (you should see the Aussies in Australia creaming their pants). If even a fraction of them decide to come here because of this spectacle, it'd be a huge win.

And let's be honest; India and Sri Lanka have a love/hate relationship. Like siblings do. But these are not siblings but nation-states. In the end, both have to work towards what's beneficial for themselves. The only difference is, unlike India, Sri Lanka doesn't have the luxury of having politicians who care even one iota about the country itself.

Don't worry brother. There was a time that majority of the Sri Lankan population thought that they can survive without foreign investment and by being self-sufficient. Now the younger generation is absolutely denied of their future.
The majority of Sri Lankans pay homage to a sport and forget that they need a sustainable future.
We Sri Lankans are not interested in finding long term solutions. 
The majority of the Sri Lankan population follow nationalist policies and failed to act rationally when needed.
This is what has ruined the future of the younger generation. The sad part is even now the people don't realize that foreign investments are important. They are still in belief that tourism will save this country. I was astonished at how the tamilnadu government was able to liberalize many sectors even with government subsidies.

Sri Lanka has not yet violated any single one of the NAM stipulations when it comes to foreign wars. Did the administration back then favor Pakistan? Maybe.

First read your very own Deepinder Singh's ***The IPKF in Sri Lanka*** and then we'll talk about genocide on ethnic Tamils.

No no no no, I admit we did commit genocide. And we did commit a lot of bad things. **However**, That does not stop the amount of irony. Meanwhile Sri Lanka was having a Civil war. You know what the Indians were doing ?. Well they were waging wars with Pakistan and other countries. Cause Kashmir.

India was not committing genocide on any Indians, it was fighting a foreign entity which aided terrorist attacks in India, was giving a safe haven to gangsters from India and involved in Anti-Indian activities.

Read about 26/11, Pulwama, and any other terrorist attack, it's foundation would be in Pakistan, what do you expect Indian to do? Cower down or take actions to prevent these activities? 26/11 was so much more fucking deadly than the 2019 Easter attacks. Terrorists with guns shooting at common people in the roads of Mumbai.

Kashmir is a new addition by Pakistan, the real reason, the Indian government took actions was to prevent terrorism, the international community recognised this and put them in FATF grey list, so Pakistan can't claim to be a terrorist free nation, so added Kashmir to the list to cry.

I am completely against Modi and the BJP government, but they did do a couple of good things, in which safeguarding India from terrorist attacks is one.",negative,negative,negative,negative
