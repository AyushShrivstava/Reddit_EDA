That is the system will treat you like a black person. For example, Toronto school board came up with a three strikes you are out policy for high school kids. After 5 years of its implementation someone did a study and found out blacks, Filipinos and Sri Lankan kids were more prone to be expelled for minor infractions by the white administration than white, North Indian, Pakistani and Chinese kids. Shows how dark color, blinds even teachers and principles and appeals to their baser instincts. Then the program was cancelled. Meanwhile thousands of kids and their entire tax paying futures were destroyed by their white teachers and principles. 

Now the police too are similarly impacted although Sri Lankan Canadian policemen have risen to the [highest position.](https://www.thestar.com/amp/news/gta/2022/11/09/peel-police-chief-nishan-duraiappah-to-receive-ontarios-highest-honour.html) So if you are seen as black by the society then you might as well take advantage where there is very little like this book store, usually it‚Äôs all negative, sorry to say.",neutral,neutral,negative,neutral
