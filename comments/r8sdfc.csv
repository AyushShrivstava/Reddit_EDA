The last time this group rioted, it led to 8 dead policemen Then the government made a deal with the group which lead to the release of their leader. Everyone said the police will not stop anyone the next time this group strikes. Lo and behold.

We deserve this international condemnation to be honest. No two ways around it. There is a limit to appeasement. We had the Taliban land mafia taking over land and killing kids in the west, and they were being appeased with brand new roads and free electricity, just so they wouldn't attack again.

Ever since this attack there has been an influx of right wing Indians on this sub and they have taken over the conversation to peddle a very specific agenda. One that isn‚Äôt pluralist but rather perhaps even more myopic in the other direction.

I wholeheartedly agree with you that the entirety of South Asia is plagued with structural issues that breeds extremism and religious fervor to mask the sheer incompetence and hopelessness of our populace.

However I don‚Äôt believe you need to make an equivalence between Sri Lanka and Pakistan, by all human development indexes Sri Lanka far suppresses us. And as a nation we Pakistanis need to seriously figure out where we have went wrong as a nation to be in the place we are now. This incident is extremely shameful and everyone in the nation feels this shame currently.
