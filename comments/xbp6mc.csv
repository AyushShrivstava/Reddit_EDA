io2la9l,t3_xbp6mc,19,0,1662947776.0,Flat-War4343,"It was fantastic effort. Totally master piece. There are bunch of things our team has improved.
- keep the run rate going even wicket falls. In the past we have never seen that. 
- didn't pressurized after quick wickets fallen.
- instead of one or two man. All of batsmen contributed to the total. 
- super energy in the field.
- less mistake in the field. 
- using balling variations. Slow balls, clutters etc. 

Way to go boys way to go. Let's bring the WC. Congratulations !

Edit- another improvement.
-Good running between wickets. Got lots of quick singles. Which was lacking in our team for decades.

io3c1zs,t1_io2la9l,6,1,1662963181.0,gifispronouncedgif,"The main takeaways from this tournament are Kusal Mendis' and Rajapakse's newfound form in t20is. Rajapakse averages like 70 this asia cup. He has a floating role, and is able to build an innings or slog at the death. He is the most vital batsmen in our team, because as this asia cup showed, if others fail he can still get it on, as his role overlaps with death powerhitters as well as top order accumulators. Moreover Kusal Mendis upping his strike rate as an opener is glorious and pairs really well with Nissanka's measured approach.

This new fearless cricket is what SL really needed, this is what SL have always been about since we started playing. 

Dds played some brilliant shots like friggin A\* drives, but im still not sure if he's the right man in the t20 wc in Aus with big boundaries. I want to see Asalanka back in form hopefully, since dds cant bowl spin overs in Aus.

Hasaranga was able to get wickets this match due to the run rate pressure, thats where he does best, when he's got a nice score to defend. My issue is that he hasnt been that good against the other sides. He needs to use his legspinner more often cos batsmen will just defend the googly otherwise.

Anyways I need not point out the good captaincy by Dasun Shanaka who's had to really learn a lot on the job. You can see his evolution from 2021 wc to nowadays, he's far more mature. He was always willing to learn and adapt and I said back then he'd be one of our best captains cos of this. His batting will be key as well, of course.",positive,positive,positive,positive
