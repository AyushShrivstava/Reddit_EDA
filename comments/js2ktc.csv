And at least before the curse she is said to have been beautiful priestess of Athena (enough to attract the god of the sea at least )",neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

gbzsofx,t1_gbyp5ka,1,2,1605144225.0,Accomplished_Bat5145,Yep it is a curse and she was beautiful. But only reason Perseus was able to look at her through his shield was because she was asleep when the hero came to kill her. But the moment she opened her eyes Perseus had to close his eyes. So it is somewhat of an eye thing but according to what I read her face is so hideous that if you see it you turn to stone.,negative,neutral,neutral,neutral
