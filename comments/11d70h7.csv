Tea Estate Workers are some of the most fucked over social groups in Sri Lanka. They live in a fucked up form of indentured servitude where entire families can be bought and sold between estates. The amount of rape, abuse, and alcoholism would be off the charts if the estates and government allowed it to be charted. If they don't work, they'll be kicked out of their line rooms.

I've hung out with some guys who were doing a study on this, and they had some hellish tales to tell.

They are the reason why we don't have an hourly wage in Sri Lanka, and even the LTTE didn't consider them worthy of fighting for.

jabbjdg,t3_11d70h7,16,0,1677559703.0,Curry_Island_Guy,"Being in estates all my life as a tea planters kid. I roamed around estates and spoke to these people. And yes they get low wages that's true, but the estates protect it's community of tea pluckers. The estate corporative gives food rations very cheap to compensate for the low wages, they receive free healthcare and protection at the highest priority (each estate has its own ambulance and is given the highest priority when admitted to the local dispensary or hospital).

 And they do have the freedom to leave the estates and find employment wherever they want (currently there's a gradual decline of estate workers as the younger generation have started to join garment factories etc, but they get abused worse over there from what I hear). But if they do leave the estates they have to leave behind the free housing given by the estates and the concessions. This makes them reluctant to find employment elsewhere and prefer being in estate communities. 

And also job security because during the pandemic most of the garment factory workers were laid off but in estates the workers have guaranteed job safety. Besides that the companies constantly try to uplift the standards of living for these people even though it's a slow process. 

These are some of the reasons amongst many others as to why these people stay in estates. 

Also the above picture is a normal sight when the estate lorry goes to town. Heck even I've hitched a ride once or twice. Please do understand that most estate workers live in extremely remote areas of the estate and there are no busses. The only mode of transport is walking, the estate tractor or lorry.

Also the estate workers are more communal and helpful to each other than you can ever imagine. Even domestic violence is not tolerated, there have been times when my father stepped in to solve domestic fights in the estates. 

So if you haven't lived in this community and interacted with actual workers of the estates (not the fellows along the nuwaraeliya main roads begging for your pity saying the estates don't treat them right)  you really shouldn't be judging what you see.

4.) Last of all do you own a cotton estate or slaves? Or in past owned one? 
People think they know everything and try to be Internet heroes 🤣 this is why as a country we will never succeed just people like you who think knows everything and anything.  All of you just learn and study about the business, culture, how they have adopted and why they have adopted certain things in life? Then talk. Just a bunch of losers trying to act so knowledgeable and kind without even knowing Jack shit.

Exploitation of labour and resources yields profit in the short term, in the long term it simply isn't stable.

Organisations and nations that rely on exploitation make it the foundation of their entire operation. This introduces a catastrophic single point of failure. (See: American Cotton Plantations, The East India Company). As a result, a single uprising/policy change/natural disaster/economic shift causes a massive cascading failure. This is not a matter of if, but a matter of when.",negative,negative,negative,negative
