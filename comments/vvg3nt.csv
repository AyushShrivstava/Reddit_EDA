An institution isn't a building it is the people. In which country does a president comes back as an MP and become the Prime Minister again. Our presidents like beggars are asking aid from other countries, closing down well functioning national institutions for their underhand deals.

This is mainly because Sri Lankans allow ""ask no questions, respect the elected"" political culture. These people are nothing, they are elected by the public, spending our money.

I live in Canada btw, you will be surprised, people here dont give a shit about the elected, you can just give a call to your MP and they will assign a case number and officer to look in to your concern.

I'm not sure what you mean by ""plenty"" I've lived 28 years in Sri Lanka and all I've known was struggle (when compared to how I'm living now). Just take a look at our public transport and we had the first tram system in Asia once upon a time.
