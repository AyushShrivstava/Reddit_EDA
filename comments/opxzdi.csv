>Religion doesn't have to be in alliance with patriarchy, but it often will, to advance its own power and influence. All major religions have done this, but it doesn't mean that religion and patriarchy is inseparable.

Why do we have to separate religion and patriarchy when we can just remove religious dogma from the equation and just go from there? But when it comes to removing  patriarchy(if you need to) it's a bit hard to do. Even though removing religious dogmas can cause ppl to question authority then which leads to soften patriarchal thinking. Don't you think?

>When it came to North America and Europe, Buddhism shed much of its sexism to make it more appealing to those looking for alternatives to Christianity and Judaism.

In here you talk about practical experience of 'Evolution of religions'. So if religion is something that keeps evolving over time, which doesn't adhere to a certain and definite set of rules why should we try so hard to keep it? Can't we just defy it as a whole? 

>Religion doesn't hold back progress. However, those who have gained power though religion may hold back progress to retain their power.

Religious thinking will always hold back progress.!! It's the way of thinking which should be changed. What religions do is holding back people from skeptical and critical thinking. And how can ppl who have gained power through religion can hold back progress to retain in power? If they hold back the progress they lose power. What they do is using religion (and common human errors) furthermore for convincing and deceiving more people to stay in power. So you see? Religion is the problem.!
