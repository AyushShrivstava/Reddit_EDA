I‚Äôm Brit and my SL husband and I were visiting family in Colombo the time of the attacks. As it all unfolded with the information that they ignored such a clear warning (they had every single detail FGS) it was just such a slap in the face to the victims. The terror attacks didn‚Äôt make me feel unsafe initially, but finding out the government knew?! And then afterwards I found it unbelievable that Wickremesinghe bastard practically slept his way through the Channel 4 interview, the man looked BORED. He was SMIRKING.

Especially when media, security, and power is in their hands. It's a power move made, they'll keep doing it. Again and again. Next time it'll be to bring the USA boots in the cities.
