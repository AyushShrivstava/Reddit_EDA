I wish I could go back in time just for a moment to see how beautiful things were back then, I hope we move towards a future of riches like the history and culture the country comes from. It's disgusting to see the self-centered nature of politicians and even the citizens that think they are better than their people once they move up in wealth. I have seen it in my own family. I wonder if it was better under a single rule. A single king? I wonder if everyone in society did have a purpose and meaning and place.
