The writer's intention is not to write anything about the ""Rajapakse"" siblings !! It is about their uncle ""Col.Gotabhaya Rajapaskse"" whose name will be remembered by all Sinhalese in SL for perpetuity !! 

A few will have bad things to say about the Col !! I for one do not care !! I would opine that there are two Colonels in the world !! One is Col.Gaddafi who is no more !! The other is our own Col.Gotabhaya Rajapakse !! Both have certain similarities!! 

They never went over their rank !! Col.Gaddafi had he wanted could have made himself the ""Emperor"" of Libya or at least a ""General Field Marshal""in the Libyan Army !! He did neither !! Col.Gotabhaya could have himself appointed at least a ""General"" !! 

After all President MR was his brother as well as the Commander-in-Chief and would have been very happy to comply if requested by the Col !! Neither did so !! As far as I know the Colonel commanded the 1st Battalion of the ""Gajaba"" Regiment !! The foremost ""fighting"" regiment of the SL Army !! 

They remained Colonels throughout, Gaddafi to the ""bitter end"". Col.Gottabhaya took certain key decisions when fighting the LTTE and faced imminent dangers which would finished off a lesser person !! 

Had the Colonel not done so or failed in his decisions, we Sri Lankans would have had to pay dearly with our lives !! Now of course, we can talk high and mighty about Human Rights and various assorted subjects !! At that point of time we were very near extinction !! After all every community has its own heroes !! In India ""King Sivaji"" is a hero !!

Try and see what happens, if someone talks bad about ""King Sivaji"" in India !! I suppose he will not come out alive !! So why cant we have our own heroes !! Is it a crime if we do so !! Now, Muslim people will always remember Colonels Fasly Lafir and Muthalif !! 

Even in the Tamil community there were and still are highly respected officers who made the ultimate sacrifice !! We must salute them all !! Their heroism and gallantry is unquestioned !! 

Likewise, whatever happens at the elections, I as at least as a Sinhalalese will get a lump in my throat whenever I remember our own Col. Gotabhaya Rajapaskse !! May the Colonel have the courage to overcome all the tribulations at this point of his life !!L",neutral,neutral,positive,neutral
