Love them. 
Someone already pointed out the hayleys spelling mistake, and also fix the SLIC one (Sri Lanka not Sri Lankan)
If it were a real client something small like that could be enough to unnerve them. 
Especially because I guarantee not all the decisions makers in a firm will be happy or ready to change something as important as a logo at the same some. Some people will be 100% against the idea even if you design something amazing, so try to leave the minimum room for those people to reject a redesign. 

I agree with the other redditor who said all except 6. It just too iconic and at best, you could keep the original guy an remove the circle and text. 

Also, if you aren‚Äôt already part of it you should join and post this on r/logodesign they‚Äôll be able to give more international and experience feedback for you
