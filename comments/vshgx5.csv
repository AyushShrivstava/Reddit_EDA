if69j6e,t3_vshgx5,14,0,1657172817.0,suchthegeek,"well this certainly got some responses, let me respond back to what people are saying  


As much as there were times ('71 and '89) where the Sinhalese people lost their freedoms and rights, there has been a long systemic and systematic loss of rights for the minorities. The modern assault on these rights and freedoms can be said to have started with Anagarika Dharmapala, and has continued to this day.  


Pointing out a few years of lack of rights does not compare favourably against the literal decades where minorities lost their rights to jobs, language, education, official documentation in a language they can understand, or even a national anthem they could understand.  


so, yes, u/Gamerindreams, I HAVE heard of the 70s uprising, my father and uncles were caught up in it. and yes, u/xCuri0 and u/LankanFD6917, it happened in 89 and in Rathupaswala, but the majority is only now feeling a small portion of what the minorities suffered. fun fact, after the Rathupaswala shooting, there was one guy on TV asking ""we supported them, why are they treating us like like this?""  


Even in this sub there were minority folks explaining why the people of the North and East are not showing up in support of GotaGoGama and \\#gotagohome. The majority Sinhalese areas are suffering from a lack of power, fuel, necessities, rights and freedoms, and they are understandably and rightfully upset by that. But for the minorities, and especially those from the North and East, it's Tuesday.",neutral,negative,negative,negative

My (army) uncle still has nightmares because he was ordered to basically save ammo by shooting 2 people with 1 bullet. And those were all Sinhalese people.
